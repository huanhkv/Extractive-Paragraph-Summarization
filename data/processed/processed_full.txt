cnn nine years ago he was an electrician.six months ago , he was worth some a 1.18 billion 1.22 billion australia s mining boom having turned him into the country s richest person under 40 years old.now , coal baron nathan tinkler , 36 , is facing a mountain of debt.his wealth has plummeted to a 400 million , thanks to slowing demand and falling coal prices , while his debts to a variety of creditors mount , reportedly hitting a 638 million.on tuesday , his personal holding company was liquidated.tinkler has had the midas touch on his way to the top of the rich list and until tuesday on the way down , too , staving off the liquidation of several of his companies.he now faces credit debt surrounding his horse racing empire , troubled sports franchises and repossession of his personal jet.while creditors have been circling for months , it was a tuesday decision of the new south wales supreme court to wind up tinkler s mulsanne resources over an unpaid a 28.4 million dollar debt that suggests the former electrician s luck may have run dry.on wednesday , the federal court place his thoroughbred horse racing and breeding empire , patinack farm administration , into liquidation with a debt of a 2 million.patinack farm s cash flow problems were reported to be so severe , tinkler was trying to stem the bleeding by downsizing operations in victoria and south australia and selling horses at bargain base prices to settle a state debt.he recently settled a a 16.6 million dispute with mirvac over a failed land purchase in sydney and a a 2 million debt to the publicly listed contractor , sedgman ltd.tinkler s woes have impacted the australian sporting world too.his hunter sports group has reportedly fallen behind in meeting player salaries for his two prized clubs the a league newcastle jets football team and the newcastle knights league club.but tinkler has come up with enough money to partially pay a significant , unpaid bill for the rent of stadiums used by the teams.and he has avoided the reported repossession of his personal jet worth a 40 million.ge capital is said to have issued tinkler an instruction to leave the french made dassault falcon 900 , replete with italian leather seats , a conference room and bar , at a regional sydney airport.instead , he flew it to singapore where he and his family now live in two adjacent homes , reportedly with a maserati and porcshe in the driveway.and in august with coal prices flailing , tinkler abandoned plans for a a 5.3 billion take over whitehaven coal , one of australia s largest coal producers with exploration assets in queensland.tinkler s aston resources , however , remains the largest shareholder in whitehaven coal with a 19.4 stake.navigating the downside of australia s commodities boom is proving to be a wild ride for nathan tinkler.as a result , the unlikely rich lister is in the business pages of australian newspapers almost daily.and he does n t much like the attention.there has definitely , absolutely , been a spirited media campaign to get me , tinkler told sydney s daily telegraph earlier this month.seeking to sooth the doubters , he added , i would say the noisy few have made a lot of people nervous and there is no need to be.the order to liquidate his personal investment vehicle would indicate the nervousness is not a fiction of a media campaign.but tinkler is accustomed to wild rides.the ride to the top for australia s fastest self made billionaire was not only wild.as a teenager , he headed for the rich coalfields of the hunter valley , north of sydney , according to a 2010 profile.there , he found work in the mines as an electrician , though a a 400 a week take home salary held little appeal.by 26 , he d formed his own mine machinery maintenance business , servicing coalmines , which were burgeoning and booming as australian commodities fueled the expansion of china s infrastructure.then came his big break.in 2006 , he raised a a 1 million loan against his home and business for a deposit on a coal tenement in central queensland.all he needed to do was raise another a 29 million to finance the deal.i knocked on every door in australia and many overseas to raise the funds.finally i succeeded after wearing out a lot of shoe leather , he told cnbc in 2010.investors came on board when exploratory drilling turned in heaven sent results high grade coal samples.sitting on a promising asset , tinkler sold it not once but twice first to macarthur coal for a 275 million plus a 10 stake in the company and a year later , in 2008 , with world coal prices soaring , he sold his stake in macarthur to global steel giant arcelormittal.his a 1 million gamble turned into a multimillion dollar pile of cash with which he went on a buying spree football and rugby league clubs , horse studs , as well as property.he also formed aston resources , a mining development vehicle , floated in 2010.the aston resources merger with whitehaven coal was his great hope and even diminished by weak coal prices , it remains his main asset.if the former electrician ca n t pull another rabbit out of his hat , faith in the midas touch may be all that remains to stave off bankruptcy
09 13 est , 11 september 2012 11 00 est , 11 september 2012 a south african man who had been in a coma for seven years was woken up after being given a sleeping pill.ayanda nqinana , from johannseburg , was left with severe brain injuries after his car crashed along an eastern cape road in 2005.his doctors said the father of one would most likely never recover.but his wife nomfundo recently read a newspaper article about other long term coma patients who had woken up after being fed sleeping pill stilnox.reverse effect a south african man who had been in a coma for seven years was woken up after being given stilnox sleeping pills she insisted her husband be given the tablets and , just five days later , mr nqinana was awake and able to talk.he even recognised relatives , including his son ayavuya , and could recall conversations from before his crash.mrs nqinana told timeslive.co.za ayavuya was so excited that he kept running to me saying mum.daddy knows my name.i will never forget the day ayanda woke up it was the happiest day of my life.stilnox , also known as ambien , is a prescription medicine used to treat insomnia by initiating sleep.contains zolpidem , which studies have found increases blood flow in the brain , particularly in areas involved in language comprehension studies into the connection between stroke rehabilitation and stilnox are ongoing.john white at moss rehabilitation center in philadelphia is leading a study into the connection.so far he has found that fewer than 10 per cent of stroke victims respond to the drug.not able to yet advise families on how to use this drug clinically because the research is in the very early stages , he said last year.the very first request he made was to see his son , and that moved me.although mr nqinana is unable to hold a proper conversation , he can say the odd word and respond using sign language such as a thumbs up gesture.but his doctor , siyabulela bungana , remains unconvinced about stilnox s ability to rouse patients out of a coma.he said he has not spoken to me.i have not seen any evidence of improvement.the case is not the first time that stilnox has woken up somebody in a coma.last december , it is believed to have roused sam goddard , 23 , after he suffered a series of strokes that left him in a coma.mr goddard , from brisbane , australia , was playing football in february 2010 when his head began to pound so severely he screamed for an ambulance.doctors told his fianc e sally jane nielson that he had suffered a staggering eight strokes , leaving him with permanent brain damage , and would never be able to walk , talk or recognise his loved ones , and would likely be blind.but after 45 days in a coma in the intensive care unit at royal brisbane hospital where he also contracted pneumonia mr goddard woke up and began making slow progress after he was given stilnox
tottenham s imminent hiring of southampton s head of recruitment paul mitchell could hasten the demise of spurs s technical director franco baldini.but spurs have been warned that instead of operating a revolving door policy for staff and attempting a short cut route to success by poaching people from better run clubs , they need a coherent plan , boardroom consistency and to back a single manager long term to achieve the progress their fans crave.mitchell , 33 , a former defender and midfielder at wigan and mk dons , has been at st mary s since 2012 and is credited with a key role in the scouting and hiring set up that helped saints emerge from a troubled summer with an upgraded squad and a 37million profit to boot.tottenham sold gareth bale to la liga giants real madrid for 86million in 2013 paul mitchell s task is to overhaul tottenham s scouting system and have the success he did at southampton tottenham technical director franco baldini could be heading for the white hart lane exit door roberto soldado spanish , 29 , f , 26.4 m six goals and six assists in 33 premier league games is a costly return.erik lamela argentinian , 22 , am , 25.7 m lavish talent but no goals in 20

dutch , 31 , 5m yedlin on loan.vorm yet to play in pl.tottenham lured manager mauricio pochettino from southampton in the summer , will add mitchell when his notice period expires in the new year and have coveted saints players included jay rodriguez and morgan schneiderlin.baldini , 54 , has been in his job since summer last year and oversaw player departures including spurs best player and talisman gareth bale for a world record 86m.but the jury has been out on many of the 13 faces brought in partly with the cash raised , from paulinho to roberto soldado to erik lamela and , more recently , federico fazio and ben stambouli.franco is pretty relaxed about the situation but he knows in football that people come and go and that he ll be moving on at some point , whenever that is , said a source.another insider familiar with the workings at both white hart lane and st mary s said of spurs it does n t appear that they have a strategy of any ilk , it seems to be a case of seeing southampton do things well so let s take a short cut and hire their people.it will work sometimes and others wo n t go near them but ultimately it s a naive approach.sustainable success is not about individuals , it s about a culture.many fans believe spurs managerial merry go round has hurt the club , with pochettino the fifth permanent boss in seven years since juande ramos joined in 2007.the turnover of players has exacerbated the situation and pochettino has been left with a squad that can not or will not function in the high tempo pressing system he used to such effect at southampton.results have suffered , with spurs losing three of their last four league games before sunday s trip to hull.the home capitulation to stoke last time out has been described as the worst performance many have seen in a long time.tottenham fan martin cloake , an author , whose latest book taking our ball back looks at discontent within the wider game.it s clear that there has been too much change in personnel recently , he says of spurs dilemma.there s not much sense of team spirit evident when we play and no real leaders stand out.paulinho and roberto soldado are among the players who have failed to impress since joining the club tottenham s harry kane has said his team mates need time to adapt to mauricio pochettino s style there are lots of players with potential flair , perhaps fewer of the type who will dig in and help to hold a team together therefore letting the flair players express themselves.off the pitch , the phrase i ve never felt so disconnected from the club i support keeps coming up.that s partly because of the discontent with the top level of football in this country but it s also because those running the club too often come across as aloof and as treating the fans as cash cows.fixing things on the pitch will take time and the vast majority of fans want pochettino to be given time.there has been too much chopping , changing and blaming.off the pitch the club just needs to show goodwill , talk to the fans more , resolve some of the uncertainties around the stadium and generally demonstrate that we re seen as supporters and not just customers.striker harry kane acknowledges a lengthy transition period could lie ahead.we have n t won as much as we d have liked.but there is a long way to go.we are adapting to the manager s style each game and we are learning.hopefully we can pick up some momentum and then who knows.the manager has come in with his style and it has only been four months.that s not long when you are changing the way you want to play.we are getting used to it and we will only get better.tottenham go into their fixture against hull in 12th spot having started slowly under pochettino
