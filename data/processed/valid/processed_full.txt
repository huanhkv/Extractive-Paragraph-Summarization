the financial crash has left the poor even poorer than they were before the recession while the rich have got richer , a new report has revealed.despite the economic collapse in 2008 , the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two thirds between 2005 and 2012 13.the poorest families meanwhile have seen a collapse in their savings and higher debts than before the downturn , a report by the social market foundation think tank found.despite the economic collapse in 2008 , the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two thirds between 2005 and 2012 13.the report said those aged 25 to 36 and those on the lowest incomes are ill prepared for future financial shocks or rises in interest rates , limiting the capacity of consumer spending to fuel growth in the uk economy.it cast doubt on claims that the uk population as a whole had reined in spending in order to pay off debts and build up savings in response to the crash.in fact , it found that most of the saving took place among the top 20 per cent of earners , who built up savings in the aftermath of the crisis to the point that their average financial wealth increased by 64 per cent between 2005 and 2012 13.the proportion of high income individuals with debts fell from 43 per cent to 31 per cent over the same period.by contrast , the 20 per cent on the lowest incomes were unable to pay off debts and start saving.over the same period , the value of debt held by poorer households rose by 67 per cent equivalent to around 28 per cent of their income and use of overdrafts rose , while savings shrank to an average of less than six days worth of income.the amount being saved by families has steadily fallen since the coalition took over , as people dip into their savings.the intergenerational gap in incomes and wealth widened over the same period , as the amount of savings held by 26 35 year olds fell by 36 per cent.while the proportion of this age group in debt fell , the average amount owed by those with debts increased by 45 per cent.just 45 per cent of 26 to 35 year olds owned a home in 2012 13 , sharply down from the 74 per cent seen in 2005.the report s co author , smf chief economist nida broughton , said our findings show that the wealth gap between rich and poor and young and old increased further during the downturn.the economic uncertainty following the crisis prompted many to pay down their debts and build up their savings.but the young and those on low incomes missed out.greater support is needed to help these individuals prepare for the future yet this will be a challenging feat.it is likely that the process of repairing their personal finances will only begin once sustained wage growth materialises

cnn the odds seemed almost impossibly stacked against baby lily , but she survived.rescuers found the toddler saturday , hanging upside down in her mother s car , which had flipped into a frigid utah river a day before.if the wreck occurred when police believe it did , she may have been there for as many as 14 hours.lily s mother , lynn jennifer groesbeck , died in the crash.she was 25 years old.how did her 18 month old survive.one of the biggest factors was the car seat.lily was in the proper car seat for her age and the seat appears to have been properly attached.even though the child was trapped and upside down , her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water.doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous , but would be even more so if the baby were wet.dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures.ironically , the cold might have actually helped lily survive , said dr.barbara walsh , with the university of massachusetts medical school.she s going to have a lower heart rate.she s going to have a lower metabolism.she s going to need less sugar , walsh said.it s almost like the body is sort of knowing that it needs to shut down to protect itself.a variety of other factors were also likely at play.we do n t know what time the child was last fed , when she drank.given that it s wintertime and she was in her car seat , she was probably wearing mittens , a hat.we tend to over bundle our children , so the fact that she was dry , she probably had on multiple layers because it s winter , and there s always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role , walsh said.a final factor may have been that the girl , as a toddler , has baby fat a little extra insulation.if she had been an infant , it might have been a different story.children are very resilient , and i think sometimes we do n t realize how much they actually can withstand , said walsh.cnn s ben brumfield and nadia kounang contributed to this report

taking statins pictured can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown.taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown.the cholesterol lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes.the risk , which is far higher than previously believed , has prompted fresh concern about the side effects of the pills.the findings are particularly worrying as last year the nhs recommended that up to 17million adults should be on statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes.the drugs rationing body nice published guidance last july urging gps to prescribe them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease in a decade.this represents around 40 per cent of adults in the uk , and academics said the advice was foolhardy when so little was known about the side effects.in the latest study , scientists from the university of eastern finland studied 8 , 749 men aged 45 to 73 over a six year period.just under a quarter were taking statins when the study started.some had only been on the pills for a few months , others for several years.over the course of the study , the scientists found that taking statins increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 46 per cent.their research , published in the journal diabetologia , found that statins reduced the ability of insulin to break down blood sugar.this is known as insulin sensitivity , and was on average 24.3 per cent lower in men who were taking statins.the cholesterol lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes.the researchers believe that if insulin does not break down blood sugar , and the body s sugar levels rise too high , then it can trigger type 2 diabetes.they concluded statin therapy was associated with a 46 per cent increased risk of type 2 diabetes.the association of statin use with increased risk of developing diabetes is most likely directly related to statins decreasing both insulin sensitivity and secretion.dr aseem malhotra , a consultant cardiologist in london , said that contrary to the nhs guidance , healthy adults should not be taking statins , adding i personally would n t take it or recommend it to friend or family member who is otherwise healthy but let them make up their own minds after giving them all the information.eating a handful of nuts or four tablespoons of olive oil may be a more effective way at reducing risk of a heart attack , stroke or death and without the side effects.professor peter weissberg , medical director at the british heart foundation , said healthy patients prescribed statins to prevent heart disease should take the lowest possible dose.he went on to warn that people with existing heart conditions should not stop taking the pills , saying it is important that people taking statins because of existing cardiovascular disease should continue to take them as the benefits will outweigh the risks

margaret thatcher is said to have ordered testing of a laser to be used in the falklands war.a secret death ray laser was developed during the falklands war and ordered for testing by the then prime minister margaret thatcher , documents reveal.britain was said to have worked with america to develop the high powered lasers for use on the battlefield during the 1970s and 1980s.the beam , nicknamed a death ray , had been developed quickly because of fears over the weapons possessed by the soviets but was never used.but lady thatcher was said to be so impressed with the technology she ordered testing to take place during the falklands war , the daily express reported.existence of the laser was revealed in the national archives , in a letter marked top secret from the then defence secretary michael heseltine to lady thatcher in 1983 about the weapons owned by the soviets and britain s position.it said you may recall that we developed and deployed with great urgency a naval laser weapon , designed to dazzle low flying argentinian pilots attacking ships , to the task force in the south atlantic.the weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted circle.the letter was revealed under the 30 year rule.sheffield academic dr david clarke found the letter in his search of the archives and said the naval laser weapon referred to a device tested , but never used in anger , when troops were defending the suez canal in 1941.margaret thatcher pictured front , centre visited hms hermes when it came back from the falklands war.this device used powerful searchlights to dazzle pilots as they attacked royal navy ships.in 1982 , when the falkland islands was invaded , it was decided to use the same tactics to try and blind enemy pilots.in the 1980s britain was said to be focused on developing medium power lasers directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes , optic and electro optic sensors.these weapons was designed to target low flying aircraft by dazzling pilots targeting ships.the death ray was said to be unlikely to be unsuccessful in targeting ships but would work on humans.britain s laser weapon research in the 1980s was covered by two programmes known as raker and shingle.according to the correspondence from mr heseltine , britain had been working with america on developing laser weapons since the 1970s.mr heseltine also detailed fears in his letter to lady thatcher about the soviets were developing a range of secret beam weapons.however he said he was uncertain whether owning these weapons was useful.in the letter he added the russians could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid 1980s in fact , the russians may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser kirov.the falklands war lasted from april to june 1982 , with the loss of 255 personnel from the uk

the last salmon fisherman on the river severn is embroiled in a legal battle with the environment agency after catching just a single fish too many.nigel mott , 71 , has been catching salmon in traditional basket traps since the 1970s and once netted up to 600 fish a year worth 100 each.but his livelihood was thrown into doubt in 2012 when the environment agency ruled that no individual fisherman could land more than 30 in a season.nigel mott is the last remaining commercial salmon fisherman on the river severn and claims it is impossible for him to make a living if he is restricted to catching just 30 fish in a season.nigel s home in stroat , gloucestershire , is around six miles from the town of lydney , off which he fishes.the 71 year old used to catch up to 600 salmon a year worth 100 each.defiant nigel continued to use his putcher rank an array of 650 basket like traps and hit the quota in just 26 days.as a protest he presented his 31st fish to the local environment agency office and was duly prosecuted.he won his case but the agency has now announced plans to appeal the decision.nigel said when i caught the 30th fish , i rang them up and told them i was going to fish in excess of the 30 i even brought them my 31st fish.they seized my fish and warned me of a prosecution which is exactly what i wanted because i was very anxious to get my evidence before a court.the environment agency introduced the new quotas amid fears that the salmon population in the severn was dangerously low.nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , has won his case , but must face another hearing in the court of appeal.after catching his 31st fish nigel was prosecuted for breaching his licence and the case was heard at the high court in london in february.nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , argued that the unreasonably low quota threatened his livelihood and would put him out of business.he claims his form of fishing has minimal impact on salmon in the severn , as his putchers stretch out just a couple of hundred metres from the riverbank.that leaves a mile of open water for the fish to swim past his cages , he argued , allowing plenty of space.despite winning the case his legal battle still shows no signs of ending as the environment agency has vowed to take it to the court of appeal.a spokesman said although the judge has at this stage ruled in mr mott s favour , we will be seeking leave to appeal to the court of appeal.all of these sites are designated to protect salmon , and these populations are currently under threat.we impose restrictions on salmon fishing for all fisheries in these areas because of the need to protect the designated habitats and fisheries

a powdered alcohol intended to be mixed up into drinks has gained approval from a federal regulator.the product , called palcohol , had received the greenlight from the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error.on wednesday , bureau spokesman tom hogue told the associated press the issues were resolved and that four varieties of palcohol were approved.but hogue noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders.dry booze a brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau.the maker of palcohol hopes to start selling the product by summer.a few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above.the approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy.several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol , including lawmakers in colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale.that bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval.concerns have included abuse by minors , the potential to snort the powder and whether palcohol s light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks.palcohol would come in a pouch , with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink.a statement on palcohol s website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer.palcohol founder mark phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early wednesday morning , and said in a subsequent email that pricing has n t yet been determined.we are n t commenting on production or distribution at this time , he wrote.the four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan , a margarita , vodka and rum.phillips added that he expects another palcohol product lemon drop should also be approved shortly.previously , phillips had said he came up with the idea for palcohol because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles.hogue said the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau regularly reaches out to the food and drug administration to get determinations on whether a product might be considered adulterated.if the fda says the product is n t adulterated , he said the bureau s evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what s in the product.potential for abuse is n t grounds for us to deny a label , hogue said

sir jeremy heywood , nicknamed sir cover up has overseen a move that will ban civil servants from speaking to journalists without prior approval.a ban on civil servants talking to journalists without prior ministerial approval will intimidate them into silence , critics said last night.the civil service code has been revised , with the threat that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister.a line has been added to the code , saying ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media.as well as raising concerns about the transparency of government , there are fears the revision could dissuade whistleblowers from coming forward meaning scandals could go undetected.the move , which follows a similar clampdown on members of the armed forces talking to the media , has been overseen by cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood , the head of the home civil service.he has been nicknamed sir cover up for preventing the chilcot inquiry into the iraq war from seeing letters and records of phone calls between tony blair and george bush.his influence is such that david cameron is said to have once joked remind me , jeremy , do you work for me or do i work for you.a source at the cabinet office which is in charge of the civil service insisted the move was an attempt to increase ministers accountability of civil servants in their department.francis maude , cabinet office minister , promised to ensure that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained.but dave penman of the fda union , which represents whitehall officials , said the move was an unnecessary , unworkable and unjustified restriction.the public has a right to open and transparent public services , yet this change now requires ministerial authorisation before a civil servant can respond or make any contact with the media from a prosecutor being asked for comment outside of court , to a job centre manager dealing with a local news story , he added.guidance to regulate contact between civil servants and the media is already in place and we can see no justification for this sudden , drastic change , other than intimidating civil servants into silence.this knee jerk decision seems to have only been made to sate unfounded and misguided ministerial mistrust.mark serwotka , of the public and commercial services union , said the ban was an attempt to prevent public servants from telling the truth about government policy , by a minister who has already admitted he wants to do as much damage as possible before he steps down by making his reforms irreversible.francis maude , cabinet office minister , promised that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained.the extension to the civil service code means the government has effectively ordered more than 400 , 000 people not to talk to reporters without its approval.a spokesman for the cabinet office said the rule clarifies an existing requirement that civil servants must clear material for publication in advance.he added there is no change to the important rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation which is protected by statute.in a letter to the fda union , mr maude said he proposes to include a footnote referencing the whistleblowing legislation within the revised code

a new tax by the european commission could see 80 per cent of small cider producers affected.four out of five british cider makers would be put out of business after a new ruling by the european commission.the uk government was formally told last week to change its current excise duty , which means cider makers that produce less than 70 hectolitres 12 , 000 pints a year do not have to pay duty.changes to the 39 year old exemption is likely to affect 80 per cent of britain s 480 cider and perry makers , according to the national association of cider makers nacm.in a statement , the european commission , said it was unanimously agreed that the uk excise duty scheme contravenes eu legislation.it said eu excise duty rules oblige member states to levy an excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages.there are no provisions which would provide for an exception to the general obligation to levy excise duty in respect of cider and perry made for sale by small domestic producers.david kaspar runs a small apple juice , cider and perry business in brookthorpe , gloucestershire , and makes under 170 hectolitres of cider from the 16 acre orchard to sell at markets and a pub.he told the observer the tax introduction would be another nail in the coffin.the exemption is fundamental to keeping craft cider making going.if we had to pay an extra 2 , 500 it would probably stop us risking making wooden barrel cider and perry because it s too fragile.it would be very sad if the tax came in.not just for financial reasons.it would hasten the demise of traditional orchards and would be another nail in the coffin of traditional cider making and would be a loss to the natural habitat.the volume of cider produced annually in the uk is in excess of 6 million hectolitres or 130 million uk gallons , according nacm.some have blamed the industrial scale cider makers who account for the production of 130 million gallons of cider in the uk every year for the intervention by the ec , according to the paper.the european commission , said it was unanimously agreed that the uk excise duty scheme contravenes eu legislation.currently those that produce less than 70 hectolitres do not have to pay an excise duty.simon russell , spokesperson for nacm , told the financial times we will make the positive case for the effect of the exemption to be protected whether by retaining the existing legislation or by other means.the treasury has been given two months to respond to the commission without a satisfactory response the commission may refer the case to the court of justice of the european union.a treasury spokesperson said the government s support for small cider makers has helped create a diverse and vibrant market , improving consumer choice and creating jobs.while we will study the commission s arguments carefully , our support for this industry will continue

the head of u.intelligence has warned congress that not renewing the nsa s controversial phone snooping program will raise the risk of another terror incident.james clapper claims failing to extend part of the patriot act , which allows the bulk collection of telephone records , will take away a vital tool in the kit of the intelligence agency.should congress not renew section 215 due to expire on june 1 then it must be prepared to shoulder the blame should an untoward incident take place , the director of national intelligence added during a question and answer session in new york on monday.warning clapper told a meeting in new york that failure to renew section 215 of the patriot act which allows mass collection of phone records would effectively raise the risk of a terrorist incident.in the end , congress giveth and congress taketh away , clapper told the group gathered at the council on foreign relations.if the congress in its wisdom decides the juice is not worth the squeeze that s fine the intelligence community will do all it can within the law to do what it can to protect the country.but i have to say , every time we lose another tool in our tool kit , it raises the risk.if that tool is taken away from us , and some untoward incident happens which could have been thwarted if we had it , i just hope that everyone involved in that decision assumes responsibility.insurance section 215 revealed by edward snowden has not prevented a single incident since it was brought in.section 215 of the patriot act which also allows the nsa to obtain surveillance warrants without naming the person being wiretapped , as well as allowing the surveillance of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity but not affiliated with a terrorist organisation was one of the most controversial powers brought to light by former security contractor edward snowden.it has since been claimed section 215 , set up in the wake of september 11 , has failed to stop one terrorist incident , leading to calls for it being reformed , or dropped altogether.senator patrick leahy brought forward a bill last year , supported by clapper , which would have meant phone companies were in charge of keeping the records rather than the fbi or nsa.but republicans blocked the sweeping overhaul when it came before the senate last november.however , clapper remains a defender of the program.section 215 , to me , is like my fire insurance policy , he said on monday.my house has not burned down , but every year i buy fire insurance just in case

goodyear believes it has a way to extend your electric car s range through tires that charge the battery as you drive on them.unveiled at this year s geneva motor show , the bh 03 concept tires combine thermoelectric and piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as the tire rolls.this tire generates electricity through the action of materials in the tire that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions , goodyear said in a statement.hot idea the goodyear bh 03 , unveiled at this year s geneva motor show , uses two advanced material technologies to capture extra energy from normal wear and tear.yahoo.reports that the thermoelectric fibers are woven into the tire , converting energy generated through friction caused by the tire s contact with the road.piezoelectric material would also capture energy generated in the normal physical deformation by strain energy harvesting.it s not clear that the tire could produce the type of energy needed to add significant miles to an electric car s travel radius.a study published in 2012 in smart materials and structures found strain energy harvesting through piezoelectric tire materials was feasible , but the experiment looked to power wireless sensors , not an entire vehicle.the company also unveiled another concept that could take drivers off the beaten path.showcasing its new triple tube tires on the lexus lf sa concept car , goodyear says the tire design has three tubes that can be inflated or deflated to respond to road conditions.high concept the lexus lf sa concept car , also unveiled , showcased goodyear s triple tube tires , which use three inflating and deflating tubes to transform the tire s shape to adapt to road conditions.the tires could change to provide extra grip during high speed driving , increase fuel economy by lowering resistance and even change shape to control against hydroplaning in snow or rain.cnet points out that goodyear has used geneva to launch forward thinking though not quite market ready concepts before , having shown off a tire with two separate rings for different road conditions at last year s auto show.the outer ring of the suv featured a slick surface with grooves to displace water while driving on a paved road while a smaller inner ring had a textured surface for traction off road

prom is supposed to be one of best nights of the year for high school juniors and seniors , but sometimes it does n t turn out that way.looking back at prom photos is sometimes an easy way to see why.weird haircuts , strange poses and wardrobe choices that are just wrong await in the latest set of pictures from awkward family photos.is it worse to be her , him or the rug.maybe they thought it was a magic carpet or something.no tuxedo , no trousers , no smile , no problem.at least the fringe on the jean shorts looks classy.there are three chandeliers in the background at this place.they did n t help to distract from the foreground.maybe the laser show in the background was an attempt to call attention away from the suit.they had their spot on the dance floor marked off with a stack of telephone books for him to stand on.the question is , who ended up with the flowers at the end of the night.where these guys were so serious looking because they were planning to fight over her after the photo was taken.when you do n t have a date , the best solution is always to go with a giant fish in a dress.the jacket and pants are even kind of cool.but the chair makes this guy shine.at least this guy did n t have to worry about shelling out for a limo or sticking his date with the corsage.as soon as the dance was over , they ran off to go compete on american gladiators.though the sunglasses made it harder for them to see other people , it does n t work the other way around.it s a well known fact there s no better way to attract a suitor than by taking a photo with a tractor.they seem really , really happy.wonder how they would feel if they saw this photo again.their first date was probably to go see the breakfast club or something else involving molly ringwald
