gary neville believes louis van gaal s greatest achievement as a football manager is the making of jose mourinho.van gaal and mourinho come face to face on saturday when the former s manchester united travel to premier league leaders chelsea.the duo have been friends since they first worked together at barcelona in 1997 where they enjoyed a successful relationship at the camp nou.louis van gaal s right greatest achievement in football is the making of jose mourinho , feels gary neville.mourinho left and van gaal will come face to face again when chelsea host manchester united on saturday.mourinho left worked under van gaal as his assistant manager at barcelona for three years in 1997.with mourinho as the dutchman s assistant , they won the la liga title twice in their first two years together in catalonia.it was van gaal who entrusted and encouraged the portuguese to go into management with the 52 year old having won titles in portugal , england , italy and spain since as well as the champions league twice.and in his column for the telegraph , neville says van gaal will be proud of his friend s achievements.a former tory leader once said when asked what their greatest achievement was new labour , the former united and england defender wrote.i can imagine louis van gaal , when answering the same question from a group of journalists , peering back from his desk and responding mourinho.ahead of saturday s clash at stamford bridge united have been dealt a quadruple injury blow with the news that phil jones , michael carrick , daley blind and marcos rojo will all be unavailable.van gaal though will be able to call on the services of the in form marouane fellaini.the belgian midfielder has scored twice in united s last four league games including a header in their 4 2 derby win over rivals manchester city on april 12.marcos rojo right is one of four united players who will miss their league trip to chelsea due to injury.the red devils have in form midfielder maraoune fellaini left available for the trip to stamford bridge.fellaini right scored united s second goal in their 4 2 win over manchester city on april 12.and neville believes mourinho may try to nulify the threat of the big belgian midfielder by selecting john obi mikel or kurt zouma in midfield.neville added as for mourinho , will he blink and deploy john obi mikel or kurt zouma in midfield alongside nemanja matic to deal with marouane fellaini in that dangerous united left channel.if he does , how will his team get hold of the ball without the rhythm of cesc fabregas in that deeper role and feed an attack already hit by the loss of diego costa.i could see united having 60 to 65 of the ball if mourinho does opt for this solution.as a tactic , this would n t ordinarily worry the chelsea manager , but the idea of van gaal going to stamford bridge and not only winning , but also dominating the ball , would maybe open up the wounds of his early encounters with barcelona while coaching real madrid , when the barca purists outplayed and beat his team well.i m also pretty sure it would not be something that roman abramovich would enjoy.my hope is that they go for each other in a manner which suggests that both feel that they are superior in the football department.john obi mikel centre right could start in midfield for chelsea in a tactic to nullify the threat of fellaini

seoul , south korea cnn lee min bok did n t laugh once when he watched the interview.the north korean defector calls the hollywood comedy vulgar , admitting he could n t even watch the whole film.yet he is still sending thousands of copies across the border from south to north korea in balloons , determined his people will see the movie in which the leader kim jong un is assassinated on screen.the regime hates this film because it shows kim jong un as a man , not a god , says lee.he cries and is afraid like us and then he s assassinated.kim is portrayed in the movie as a katy perry loving , sensitive soul with daddy issues , clashing with the all powerful image beamed out by pyongyang s tightly controlled state media and propaganda machine.at 1 a., lee makes a final check of the wind speed and direction , then heads towards the border with north korea.the south korean police and military drive closely behind.after pyongyang fired on similar propaganda balloons recently , they are monitoring launches very closely.we can help towards reunification with these balloons , says lee.it costs millions of dollars to buy a f 22 fighter jet which the south korean government insist they need and that s not for peaceful purposes.so why do civilians like me have to do this under cover of darkness.at 3 a., lee fills the balloons with helium and ties the bundles of dvds , dollar bills and political leaflets to the bottom.a timer is attached which will release the bundle once safely in north korean territory.he has no way of knowing what will happen to the goods after that.he does n t know if ordinary north koreans will watch the movie and read the leaflets.the fact that pyongyang acts with fury against these so called propaganda balloons suggests some information is seeping through to the hermit kingdom.if you tell the truth in north korea , you die.but by using these balloons from here , i can tell the truth in safety , lee adds.the decision to launch the balloons in the dead of night is not just to avoid confrontation with north korea , but also with south korea s local residents.after pyongyang fired on balloons last october and south korea returned fire , those living close to the border have been trying to physically stop the launches , arguing they are being put in the line of fire.the chances of at least some north koreans having watched the film that north korea sees as an act of terrorism is certainly possible

university students who smoke cannabis can expect to get lower grades across the board but especially if they are studying maths , a new study has revealed.statistics collected at maastricht university in holland , where cannabis is decriminalised , have shown that students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses.at the same time , foreign students who did not have ready access to the mind bending drug did better on average , the observer reported.the study will rankle with the increasing number calling for the legislation of cannabis around the world.economists olivier marie from the dutch university and ulf z litz of iza made their findings based on what happened in maastricht in 2011 when the city let only german , dutch and belgian nationals have access to its 13 coffee shops , where cannabis was sold.the restriction was put in place to combat drug tourism which was thought to be tarnishing the city s image.tourists particularly from france and luxembourg were visiting masstricht solely to smoke cannabis.marie and z litz studied the 54 , 000 sets of grades from students all around the world and came to a stark conclusion.in a paper recently unveiled at the royal economic society conference in manchester the economists showed plainly that those without easy access to the drug did better in their studies on average.the temporary prohibition constrained consumption amongst the non german , dutch and belgian nationals and their brain function improved.students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses.marie was quoted as saying the difference was found to be similar to those observed in the us when students reach legal drinking age.the change before and after restriction was seen to be even more pronounced amongst low achievers.without access to cannabis they had a 7.6 percent chance of passing the courses.the pair also came to stark conclusions when looking at stats for maths students.for those courses numerical skills the policy effect was five times larger.for those stuying courses with numerical skills the policy effect was five times larger , the maastricht university pictured study stark concluded.while there is increasing clamour for the legalisation of cannabis across the world , the economists say there is very little evidence of how the drug which has been linked to psychosis affects society.coffee shops may start to spring up in berlin with uruguay planning to be the first country to fully legalise the drug.the drug study says if marijuana is legalised like it is in many states in the us , we should at least inform consumers about the negative consequences of their drug choices.consuming thc tetrahydrocannabinol the active ingredient in cannabis is much the same as drinking pure vodka it concludes.marie , a father , said the study has informed how he advises his own 13 year old son , about cannabis and he shares the findings as a precautionary measure.the economists say there is little evidence of how the drug , linked to psychosis , affects wider society

church of england schools should stop selecting pupils on faith because it discriminates against the poor , a group of vicars has claimed.they say the system is open to abuse and many oversubscribed schools reject non churchgoing families even though they may live nearby.many christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services , a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos.many christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services , a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos but a group of vicars say it can lead to discrimination against the poor.but the clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a c of e school , which are often high performing.in an open letter published yesterday , an alliance of left leaning clergy and laypeople called for an end to religious selection.they claimed the church was being turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged , and said it presented a slow burning crisis.the comments , made in a letter to the guardian , sparked anger from the church of england , which labelled their arguments doctrinaire.the letter s 20 signatories included christina baron , lay member of the general synod , barry sheerman , huddersfield labour mp since 1979 , and theo hobson , a theologian and religious commentator.the letter s 20 signatories included christina baron , lay member of the general synod , barry sheerman left huddersfield labour mp since 1979 , and theo hobson , a theologian and religious commentator right.simon barrow and jonathan bartley of the christian think tank ekklesia also signed it , as did reverend richard kirker , founding member of the lesbian and gay christian movement.also on the list were reverend una kroll , a women s equality campaigner , former teachers union president john swallow and oxford professor keith ward.referring to a 2013 survey by the sutton trust , they said 6 per cent of parents with a child at a state funded school admitted to attending church services in order to get their child into a church school.they said the level of false church attendance rose to 10 per cent among affluent parents in the socio economic group a.the letter said on a superficial level this is in the church s interest , as attendance figures in many parishes are inflated and the standard of our schools boosted by the admittance of children from more affluent families.ultimately however the universality of the church is being turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged.we believe this issue presents a slow burning crisis.we urge the church to review and then amend its national guidance on pupil admissions , so that schools are guided towards having open admission arrangements.church of england schools should look outwards , as an expression of the warmth and generosity of its mission to the whole community.yesterday , a church spokesman said the arguments set out in the letter are so flawed and inaccurate they need to be placed in special measures.the interpretation of the data cited is mistaken and the arguments doctrinaire.rev nigel genders , the church s chief education officer , said the church s secondary schools have an average of 10 per cent selection by religious criteria and some have more pupils on free school meals than the national average.he continued we run christian schools for everyone , providing an inclusive and effective education , we are not as the article seems to imply running schools for middle class christians.simon calvert , of the christian institute , added there s a push to try to secularise church schools and it s a shame that a group of liberal anglicans are playing into that

a labour government would take action to enforce a premier league commitment to invest five per cent of the proceeds from lucrative tv rights deals in grassroots sport , the party has said.shadow health secretary and keen football fan andy burnham said the move could unlock 400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament.and he said labour was ready to legislate if necessary to ensure elite clubs lived up to their 1999 promise to support struggling community facilities and projects.andy burnham left and ed miliband promise that labour will make the premier league invest in grassroots.mr burnham accused prime minister david cameron of failing to get tough on the premier league despite a massive increase in its tv revenues during his time in power.although the league puts 168million into grassroots sport , this represents only a fraction of the 5billion it has taken in from tv deals between 2013 and 2016 , said labour.mr burnham said the last labour government secured a commitment from the premier league that five per cent of all tv income should be invested in the grassroots.since then , tv rights have soared by over 160 per cent , but david cameron has failed to make sure that the game s elite honours its obligations to the next generation coming through.david cameron is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the premier league.football at grassroots is struggling and , in many cities , premier league stadia loom over run down changing rooms and overgrown pitches.the gap between top and bottom in our national sport has never been wider.premier league clubs only have permission to sell their rights collectively if they can demonstrate that it is in the wider public interest.that is why a labour government will take action to ensure that every penny the premier league owes is paid in full , unlocking an estimated 400 million for the grassroots in the next parliament.labour sports spokesman clive efford added we will get tough and under labour s better plan we will make sure the premier league lives up to its commitment to invest in the grassroots.this will have a profoundly positive impact on football and many other sports.bt sport and sky sports were part of the lucrative tv deal estimated around 5billion starting in 2016.a premier league spokesman said the success of the premier league benefits the development of the english game outside of the top flight.significant investment has flowed through all levels of the game from the grassroots upwards , and well in excess of the five per cent of domestic live broadcast revenues agreed in 2005.only last month premier league clubs committed to investing at least 1bn outside of the league from 2016 2019.that will mean even more investment in grass roots football.currently we invest 56m per season in this important work and premier league football will generate over 1.2 bn in tax revenue for the treasury this year alone.this investment has seen over 50 new artificial pitches built in local communities and our club s coaches delivering thousands of pe lessons in primary schools across the country during the 2014 15 season.grassroot football is crucial to the development of young players and good facilities like this are needed

i yield to no one in my love of the old days warm beer , cricket on the village green , bobbies on bicycles two by two , all that but it s rare a chance arises to compare the rose tinted past with the brave new world , as it did on saturday evening when sky s high octane premier league coverage went head to head with arsenal v reading in the fa cup semi final on the bbc.as we know , the premier league has the money and prestige , but what the fa cup has is history , and boy does the bbc love a bit of history.lest you were in any doubt , its coverage of the semi final kicked off with footage of the late sir laurence olivier doing the st crispin s day speech from the film of henry v we happy few , we band of brothers , and so on.gary lineker , alan shearer , jason roberts and ian wright fronted the bbc s coverage at wembley.bbc presenter lineker prepares to present the match of the day 50th anniversary special broadcast.reading defender nathaniel chaloboah left chases arsenal midfielder aaron ramsey right on saturday.gunners forward alexis sanchez celebrates after scoring his side s winning goal in the fa cup semi final.stand in match of the day presenter gabby logan left with pundits phil neville and robbie savage right.the excuse , i guess , was that reading s nickname is the royals , but as the second tier team are also known as the biscuitmen.the bbc even gave us a moment of history at half time with a breakdown , something that used to be a regular feature of tv outside broadcasts , when a feature on crystal palace s shock semi final victory over liverpool 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through.in such instances , the bbc is lucky to retain the services of gary lineker , the best presenter of live football on tv.sky have never really replaced the disgraced richard keys , who had the benefit of longevity in the post.the bbc needs to fight hard to avoid lineker falling into the hands of rivals.not that sky s presenters are less than competent david jones did the job but it s never a good sign when you have to go to google to check which one it is.the price of live premier league football is now way beyond the reach of the bbc , which may be the clincher in lineker s future.while the bbc s match had the lion s share of the goalmouth action , it was difficult to resist turning over to sky on occasion.having invested its billions in the premier league , sky does n t skimp on the peripheries.the sound always seems a little crisper , and in punditry , where sky offers us the rolls royce of analysts , gary neville , the bbc counters with the mid range danny murphy.in the commentary box , sky fields martin tyler for its big games in the knowledge he ll rarely make a bad call , while the bbc never seems sure who its best commentator is.the man on the job on saturday , steve wilson , is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story.the outcome on sky was depressingly predictable.the bbc may miss out on the premier league s pricey weekly thrills , but took the biscuit on saturday.the bbc s dan walker talks pitchside with sportsmail s martin keown at wembley.sky sports pundits graeme souness left and thierry henry right discuss their match analysis

cnn hawaii is poised to become the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to anybody under age 21.the state s legislature on friday passed a bill raising the minimum legal age currently 18 to buy tobacco or e cigarettes.the bill will now go before gov.david ige , whose signature would make it law in hawaii as of january 1 , 2016.forty six u.states permit the sale of tobacco to anyone 18 or older , while alabama , alaska , new jersey and utah require customers to be at least 19.dozens of cities and towns , including new york , have already raised the minimum legal age for tobacco purchases to 21.this bold step will reduce smoking among young people , save lives and help make the next generation tobacco free , said matthew l.myers , president of the campaign for tobacco free kids , in a prepared statement.increasing the sale age to 21 will reduce tobacco use among youth and young adults , age groups when nearly all smoking begins and that are heavily targeted by the tobacco industry , he said.it was not clear monday whether ige would sign the bill , although on friday he approved legislation banning the the use of e cigarettes in all locations where smoking is illegal.a spokeswoman for the governor told cnn in an email that he would need some time to review the bill.the legislation comes after a report last month from the institute of medicine that said barring people under age 21 from buying cigarettes would have significant public health benefits.setting the minimum age at 21 nationwide would result in nearly a quarter million fewer premature deaths and 50 , 000 fewer deaths from lung cancer among people born between 2000 and 2019 , the report estimated.report predicts big health benefits if we do.teenagers , especially those between 15 and 17 , are most vulnerable to addiction at a time when their brains are still developing , said the study , which was conducted at the request of the u.food and drug administration.if the minimum legal age for tobacco use was raised to 21 , the prevalence of smokers among today s teens would decline by 12 when they become adults , the report said.under the hawaii bill , anyone caught breaking the law would face a 10 fine for the first offense and a 50 fine or community service for a second offense.a 2014 survey of hawaii voters found that 71 favored raising the legal age to 21
