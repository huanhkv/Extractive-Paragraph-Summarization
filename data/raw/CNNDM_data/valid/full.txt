the financial crash has left the poor even poorer than they were before the recession -- while the rich have got richer , a new report has revealed .. despite the economic collapse in 2008 , the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two-thirds between 2005 and 2012/13 .. the poorest families meanwhile have seen a collapse in their savings and higher debts than before the downturn , a report by the social market foundation think-tank found .. despite the economic collapse in 2008 , the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two-thirds between 2005 and 2012/13. the report said those aged 25 to 36 and those on the lowest incomes are ` ill-prepared for future financial shocks or rises in interest rates ' , limiting the capacity of consumer spending to fuel growth in the uk economy .. it cast doubt on claims that the uk population as a whole had reined in spending in order to pay off debts and build up savings in response to the crash .. in fact , it found that most of the saving took place among the top 20 per cent of earners , who built up savings in the aftermath of the crisis to the point that their average financial wealth increased by 64 per cent between 2005 and 2012/13 .. the proportion of high-income individuals with debts fell from 43 per cent to 31 per cent over the same period .. by contrast , the 20 per cent on the lowest incomes were unable to pay off debts and start saving .. over the same period , the value of debt held by poorer households rose by 67 per cent - equivalent to around 28 per cent of their income - and use of overdrafts rose , while savings shrank to an average of less than six days ' worth of income .. the amount being saved by families has steadily fallen since the coalition took over , as people dip into their savings. the intergenerational gap in incomes and wealth widened over the same period , as the amount of savings held by 26-35 year-olds fell by 36 per cent .. while the proportion of this age-group in debt fell , the average amount owed by those with debts increased by 45 per cent .. just 45 per cent of 26 to 35-year-olds owned a home in 2012/13 , sharply down from the 74 per cent seen in 2005 .. the report 's co-author , smf chief economist nida broughton , said : ` our findings show that the wealth gap between rich and poor and young and old increased further during the downturn .. ` the economic uncertainty following the crisis prompted many to pay down their debts and build up their savings .. but the young and those on low incomes missed out .. ` greater support is needed to help these individuals prepare for the future ; yet this will be a challenging feat .. it is likely that the process of repairing their personal finances will only begin once sustained wage growth materialises .

years into the future , if historians look back at our convenience-obsessed era and pick one single product to sum up all of its follies , they will surely choose the disposable wet wipe .. these moistened towelettes promise so much .. they save us the apparent drudgery of having to dampen traditional cloths ( that need washing when we 've finished with them ) or having to remove make-up with face wash and a flannel .. for parents , they also offer an easy solution to the mess babies make of themselves .. but it now seems that our lazy ways have come at great environmental cost .. yesterday , a report by the marine conservation society revealed that wet wipes have become the fastest growing cause of pollution on our beaches .. its volunteers are picking them up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre .. wet wipes have grown in popularity - from kitchen and toilet wipes to moistened towelettes for keyboards. meanwhile they are clogging up our sewers , creating floods of noxious waste , and also triggering outbreaks of serious allergies .. over the past few years , our love affair with wet wipes has grown .. if there 's a part of our body or house that might harbour dirt , we 'll happily buy a wipe marketed specifically to sweep it away at the flick of a wrist .. kitchen wipes , toilet wipes , face wipes , hand wipes , keyboard wipes , antibacterial wipes , baby wipes .... with babycare , the cocktail of chemicals scarcely have a chance to dry on our little ones ' skin before we slather them with another one .. in the uk , we use on average between 1,500 and 2,250 baby wipes per child , from the day they are born until they reach three , according to the market analysts euromonitor .. that 's far more than any other country in europe .. our obsession does n't stop with keeping our babies clean .. we spend more than # 500 million a year on wipes of all kinds , be they budget kitchen-cleaning ones that crowd pound-store shelves , or deluxe products such as l'occitane en provence 's citrus-scented ` refreshing towelettes ' costing # 7 a pack -- that 's 50p a wipe .. our spending on these products is forecast to continue leaping by # 10 million every year .. once used , they are all too often casually tossed down the loo -- with disastrous consequences .. huggies pure wipes may contain the chemical methylparaben , which according to some researchers may cause skin toxicity. last year , a sewer pipe under shepherd 's bush , west london , became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish , known as a ` fatberg ' , that was the length of a boeing 747 .. thames water said wet wipes were a major cause -- because of the way they clog together with fat , grease and oil .. the blockage caused raw sewage to flood into nearby homes , up through the toilets and sinks .. it took thames water workers four very unpleasant days to clear .. three years ago , a similar blockage caused a tsunami of sewage to pour into the menai strait near anglesey and this year southern water said more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in kent .. the problem is that the wipes are not simply a dampened form of paper towel .. they are usually made from a combination of plastics , wood pulp and cotton .. the material is hard to break down and can float about our sewers and seas for years .. buying supposedly ` flushable ' wet wipes make no difference , says thames water .. marine conservation society volunteers are picking wet wipes up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre. the sensible answer may seem simply to throw used ones into the bin .. but even in landfill they create problems , due to the combination of alcohol , preservatives , fragrances , cleaning and moisturising agents with which they are impregnated .. the antibacterial alcohol also kills the bacteria and enzymes which we rely on to break down solid waste in landfill sites -- and in septic tanks , too .. do n't think that composting them is a good idea , either .. the synthetic fibres wo n't break down , while the chemicals and preservatives will pollute your plants and kill off the soil 's ecology .. but it is the effects on humans that should worry us most .. a number of scientific papers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems , most notably dermatitis and eczema .. numerous cases of skin rashes have been reported , most often on babies ' skin and also on their parents ' hands .. one of the key culprits is a preservative chemical -- the substance methylisothiazolinone ( or mi , for short ) .. a sewer pipe under shepherd 's bush , west london , became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish , known as a ` fatberg ' ( pictured ) , last year. researchers at the leeds centre for dermatology and the st john 's institute of dermatology at st thomas ' hospital in london say this chemical is to blame for an increasing number of allergic reactions .. indeed , two years ago , the american contact dermatitis society identified the chemical as the ` allergen of the year ' .. the british association of dermatologists dedicated its annual conference to discussing mi in 2013 , and persuaded the industry body , cosmetics europe , to tell its members to remove mi from any of their products that are left on the skin .. this ban would include wet wipes , the british association of dermatologists assumed .. but when , last july , the european commission issued its own directive banning mi from products that stay on the skin , it appears to have omitted wet wipes .. what is certain is that wet wipes containing the chemical are still readily available .. tesco and sainsbury 's own-brand antibacterial wipes both feature mi , according to their websites .. as for other brands , it is hard to tell , as research by belgian experts showed that mi is not necessarily included on wet wipes ' labels .. and once anyone becomes sensitised to mi , by skin contact with wet wipes , they can suffer allergic reactions -- such as widespread skin rashes or outbreaks of eczema -- simply by sniffing the chemical from numerous sources such as the fumes from paint , according to a report by danish investigators .. researchers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems , most notably dermatitis and eczema ( a little girl 's eczema on her legs ). meanwhile , a host of other chemicals found in popular brands of wet wipes , such as polyhexamethylene biguanide , are also suspected as the cause of serious allergies .. in addition , there is growing research that links over-use of antibacterial wet wipes with allergic conditions such as asthma .. this could be linked to the ` hygiene hypothesis ' -- the theory that over-clean modern homes deny youngsters the mild exposure to bugs that their immune systems need for them to develop healthy responses to bacteria , rather then overreacting to harmless things such as household dust .. in the meantime , thames water offers an alternative -- freshu , a foaming gel designed to be applied to standard loo paper , as a diy sewer-friendly wet wipe .. but perhaps the best answer is to jettison our convenience-driven neuroses about everyday dirt and germs .. as study after study has shown , the safest and most effective answer to dangerous dirt is simple soap and water .
forget the bragging rights - victory in sunday 's liverpool vs manchester united clash could be worth as much as # 70million .. while nothing will be decided in the latest installment of the old rivalry , at 3.20 pm we will be a lot closer to knowing who will be in pole position to land a treasured place in the top four and the champions league qualification that brings .. the victors can look forward to a # 70m cash bonanza from appearing on europe 's biggest stage thanks to the tv money and gate receipts that brings .. louis van gaal ( left ) and brendan rodgers come face to face in a huge clash at anfield on sunday. after united 's disappointing 2013-14 season , they will be desperate to break into the top four this time around. liverpool are two points behind manchester united in the league , and desperate to topple their rivals. group participation : # 6.3 million. qualification to round of 16 : # 2.54 m. gate receipts per match ( united ) : # 2m. gate receipts per match ( liverpool ) : # 1.5 m. ( numbers based on 2013/14 figures ). the losers , however , may be advised to find out what number itv4 is on their tv boxes and brace themselves for the prospect of a fraction of that sum from the europa league .. in the packed stands it will all be about what happens on the pitch .. in the directors box , however , officials will no doubt be calculating the rewards of glorious victory and the cost of miserable defeat .. should louis van gaal 's visitors triumph in the early kick-off they will stretch the gap on liverpool to five points with eight matches to play .. victory for brendan rodgers 's resurgent reds would see them take over fourth spot by a point .. a draw and the advantage remains with the visitors from the other end of the ship canal .. while officials from both clubs are desperate to make the champions league , failure to do so would do more damage to the old trafford coffers .. there has been plenty at stake in previous matches , but champions league money is now bigger than ever. andy cole ( left ) and david beckham celebrate during a united vs liverpool clash in 1997-98. liverpool are two points behind united going into sunday 's huge game at anfield. united , perennial participants , are already counting the cost of this year 's non-participation .. figures recently released reveal that they are set to see a drop in revenue of around # 50m as a result of their inability to qualify under david moyes .. should they repeat the trick this year that figure will rise to around # 70m thanks to the new tv deal with bt sport which is worth an extra # 20m .. then there is united 's # 750m kit deal with adidas .. that features a # 22.5 m penalty should they fail to qualify for the champions league for two consecutive seasons .. if the unthinkable happens , the loss would hit a staggering # 100m .. david moyes ' failure to reach the top four last season has made success imperative this time around. liverpool got a taste of the champions league this season , and will want the same again in 2015-16. the impact another year without champions league football would have on existing and potential sponsors can not be quantified but it could run into the millions .. united have a vast commercial operation with offices in manchester , mayfair and hong kong aimed at squeezing every penny out of their global brand .. while they could label one year without champions league football as a one-off , investors may see two years of non-qualification as more of a trend .. that logic would no doubt spread to the new york stock exchange where failure to qualify could have an impact on the club 's share price .. united are used to european success , and will want to recreate nights like this - moscow in may 2008. much of their success came under sir alex ferguson ( centre ) , and they have struggled since his retirement. in 2013-14 , when united were knocked out by bayern munich in the quarter finals , they picked up # 31.3 m in broadcasting money alone .. as for prize money , uefa pay around # 800,000 for each win and # 415,000 for a draw .. there is also the extra gate receipts , although this would be offset by an appearance in the europa league .. season ticket holders at united commit to buying tickets for european matches and they would be looking to pick up around # 2m per game .. sunday 's match is set to be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries around the world. cristiano ronaldo ( left ) and david beckham ( right ) left manchester united for real madrid. all of the above would help both clubs when it comes to complying with financial fair play regulations .. however , the latest , staggering # 5bn tv deal for premier league tv rights is a game changer .. united privately believe that could give them the clout to finally overtake real madrid and end the talent drain that saw cristiano ronaldo and david beckham depart old trafford for the bernabeu .. there is not only champions league cash up for grabs .. van gaal ( second left ) speaks to his players during a training session at the club 's carrington training ground. united 's first team were readying themselves for sunday 's match in training on friday morning. at the end of the season the premier league dishes out ` merit ' money based on finishing position .. last year the difference between arsenal , who finished fourth and everton , who finished fifth , was # 1.24 m.. liverpool and united are seemingly out of the title race .. this is not a battle for honours but the match is set to be the most-viewed of the season .. it will be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries with the global fanbase enjoyed by both a major factor .. there is much more than three points at stake , but then there always has been .

'. jess , who is also 16 , uses twitter to get involved in campaigns like no more page three .. this episode shows how social media can be a force for good among teens , by engaging them in current issues and broadening their horizons .. but it also shows that having teens so closely linked 24/7 also allows tensions to become inflamed and how easy it is for bullying to start .. in the show , jess is seen inviting a campaigner from no more page three to come and give a talk at the school about the issue .. rebecca and harry m , who feature on a later episode of the documentary series. during the debate , many of the pupils side with page three , believing that a woman with her breasts out does no harm .. when harry says that it is simply tradition , the anti-page three campaigner says that is not a good reason to keep something and likens it to slavery , which she also calls a tradition .. the comment has an inflammatory effect on the pupils present , who quickly take to social media sites like twitter to attack the lecture , with many blaming jess because she organised it .. later that evening , the pupils continue to whip up a storm on social media and jess reads multiple comments about herself being an attention seeker and that someone has called her fat which is retweeted several times .. she cries in front of the cameras and says that the comments have really affected her self-esteem .. the producers then talk to a group of girls from the school who have also been attacked on social media .. one says : ` it 's hard on twitter because you do n't have to tag someone 's name on it , so you can twist it and say it was n't about them , even when it clearly is .. another adds : ` someone wrote " these are the ugliest girls in the year " on twitter and listed lots of my friends ' names underneath , i was on there as well . '. shauna , melissa and james all take part in a later episode of the programme. but while jess labels the twitter drama ` world war three ' during the evening when the abuse is at its worse , the next day everyone is back at school and smiling and joking .. it becomes clear that although the teenagers are able to be highly aggressive to each other when behind their computers , they have also become very adept at recovering from the situation the next day .. harry says : ` when you say something to someone on social media , you are n't aware of the consequences .. ` they ca n't come and find you and that 's why people find it quite good .. ` twitter beef is probably the most entertaining thing in society .. ` i stick to the thing where i 'd say to someone on social media what i would say to them in real life . '. but possibly the biggest change is how nothing , not even the amount of sleep you had the night before , is private any more .. the schoolmates tweet about everything from a failed biology test , two six hours sleep and how they were let down by a girl .. just fifteen years ago , a teenager could leave year 11 as a preppie schoolboy and come back three months later as a goth in the sixth form .. these days that kid would be papped heading down to the corner shop for a pint of milk mid-transformation and it would be on the web for their peers to see within minutes .. social media and unlimited internet on smart phones has given these teens the freedom to interact with their friends all night , but they 've paid a hefty price - real expression .. teens airs tonight , tuesday 24 march , on channel 4

jerusalem ( cnn ) either benjamin netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in israeli history and beyond , or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election .. polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire , with netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger , isaac herzog of the zionist union party .. only four days before the election , polls showed herzog taking a four-seat lead into the final weekend before the election .. exit polls on the night of the election showed netanyahu had closed the gap .. the polls suggested he was in a dead heat , with a very even split between right-wing and left-wing parties .. not more polls or surveys , but actual counts from the ballot boxes .. netanyahu was n't in a fight for his political life after all .. he was the clear winner , running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government .. although the results are unofficial , it seems almost certain that netanyahu will remain the israeli prime minister .. avi degani , a pollster , professor at tel aviv university and president of the geocartography knowledge group , saw very different results from his own polls .. he never anticipated a zionist union victory .. instead , he says , he always saw likud holding a lead .. the mistake that others made , according to degani , was in the methodology .. " the internet does not represent the state of israel and the people of israel , " he said , referring to modern statistical methods .. " it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- tel aviv , better-educated , more participants in this kind of conversation .. and people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote likud , i think , are poorly represented . ". " i have tested sometimes at the same night , doing by telephone as i do always -- and very specifically geographically , and very well-weighted and very well , having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time i did on the internet .. and i got results which are very , very different . ". but mina tzemach , the polling expert for cnn affiliate channel 2 israel , suggests netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap " like a magician , " using the election polls as his final trick .. " the polls showed that they are going to lose .. it gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians .. netanyahu used it , " said tzemach .. " many voted what we call strategic voting .. they did not vote to the party that is their first preference , but they voted for the likud . ". likud voters did not participate in exit polls , according to tzemach , and that skewed the results , leading many to believe that herzog had tied netanyahu .. " we had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former soviet union , " explained tzemach .. " in these ballots , more than 30 % did not participate in our polls , and they are likud supporters . ". another factor that may have worked in netanyahu 's favor was his likud party cannibalizing votes from other right-wing parties .. in the days before the election , netanyahu moved to the political right , making a big push for right-wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties , such as naftali bennett 's jewish home party and avigdor lieberman 's yisrael beiteinu party .. during the weekend before the election , netanyahu took part in a right-wing rally in tel aviv 's central rabin square .. he continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election .. his most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two-state solution .. " anyone who is going to establish a palestinian state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical islam against israel , " he said in a television interview .. " this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years . ". in 2009 , in a speech known as the bar ilan speech , netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two-state solution , saying , " let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions .. israel is committed to international agreements , and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations .. i say to the palestinians : we want to live with you in peace , quiet , and good neighborly relations . ". tzemach estimates that likud took four seats from jewish home and two more seats from yachad , a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the knesset , israel 's parliament .. exit polls in israel have been wrong before .. in the most recent elections in 2013 , exit polls showed yair lapid 's centrist yesh atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the knesset .. but when the final results were tallied , lapid won 19 seats , becoming a major player in the government .. this time , the unexpected surprise worked in netanyahu 's favor , turning the campaign race into an election night rout .. likud had never polled better than approximately 25 seats , but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee based on 99 % of the vote .. netanyahu has worked this sort of magic once before .. in the 1996 elections , early results showed the labor party 's shimon peres as the winner , but as more results came in , netanyahu eked out a victory by fewer than 1 % of the votes .. degani said this election reveals the truth behind israeli politics .. " this last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left .. we have only right and extreme right , which is not nice sometimes .. and in the right , you have the likud mostly , and in the likud , you have mostly netanyahu . "

a chip shop in the french skiing village of val d'isere has been forced to shut down after the former chairman of l'oreal complained about the ` nauseating smell ' of chips wafting up his luxury lodge .. sir lindsay owen-jones - a welsh-born oxford graduate who stepped down as head of the cosmetics giant in 2006 - had demanded the eatery close because it was an ` olfactory nuisance ' .. the multimillionaire - who received an # 83million pay-off upon leaving l'oreal - said the smell of the mobile snack stall represented ` an abnormal disturbance ' to his life in val d'isere , adding that he felt it had also decreased the value of his luxury ski lodge .. now a french court has demanded owner valerie maerten close the stall , despite her lawyer having argued that his client 's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman 's ` precious nostrils ' over the course of seven years of legal wranglings .. wealthy : sir lindsay owen-jones ( pictured with his wife cristina ) had demanded the val d'isere chip show cease business because it was an ` olfactory nuisance '. a french court has now demanded that the chip shop owner valerie maerten close her popular stall. sir lindsay was finally successful in having the chip shop closed today , having previously launched six other legal cases demanding that it cease operating .. when the legal action was launched six years ago , he and three wealthy neighbours demanded damages for a decrease in the value of their homes .. his lawsuit argues that the stall , which is extremely popular with skiers who buy chips there throughout the day , produces ' a very important olfactory nuisance due to the cooking and frying odours that rise up into their flats and on to their balconies ' .. what 's more , it adds , the stall spoils the ` view and exceptional tranquility ' of the apartment , as there are ` numerous chairs ... multi-coloured parasols , dustbins and vehicles ' in front of it , the paper said .. however , ms maerten 's lawyer , maitre francois bern , retorted that multi-millionaire sir lindsay , whose former company makes world-famous scents , is engaging in ` judicial harassment ' to protect nostrils accustomed only to inhaling fine aromas .. during the trial he added : ` this is a lawsuit brought by rich people who live in silk and comfort , who only inhale perfume and who want to stop this lady from living . '. lost cause : over the course of seven years of legal wranglings , valerie maerten 's lawyer argued that his client 's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman 's ` precious nostrils '. prestigious : val d'isere - the french alps resort where the chip shop is based - attracts a well-heeled crowd. sir lindsay was finally successful in having the chip shop closed today , having previously launched six other legal cases demanding that it cease operating. responding to the decision , ms maerten told wwd : ' i do n't know whether i will appeal the decision .. this has been going on since 2008 .. i am financially and physically exhausted .

beer is one of the world 's most ancient brews and has played an essential role in society - both for its nutritional and ritual importance - for millennia .. now , 5,000-year-old fragments of pottery used by ancient egyptians to make beer , have been discovered on a building site in tel aviv , israel .. the pottery shards come from large ceramic basins , which were used to prepare fruity beer that was left to ferment under the sun .. ` among the hundreds of pottery shards ( pictured ) that characterise the local culture , a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer , ' dr barkan said. diego barkan , of the israeli antiquities authority , said that 17 pits were found that had been used to store produce in the early bronze age , from 3,500 to 3,000 bc .. beer was the favourite drink of humans and gods in ancient egypt .. it was also drank by rich and poor , adults and children .. this was because it was cleaner than water , which came from a river or canal and was often polluted .. beer was considered as staple , along with bread , reshafim.org reported .. workers were paid with bread , oil , beer and vegetables by their employers .. the standard ration was two jars containing three-and-a-half pints ( two litres ) of beer .. just like today , the egyptians liked their beer cooled and kept jars in water .. ` among the hundreds of pottery shards that characterise the local culture , a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer , ' he said in a statement .. the vessels were made with ` straw temper ' and other organic material to strengthen them -- a method which was not in local potteries .. the excavation is the first to offer evidence of an ` egyptian occupation ' in the centre of tel aviv 5,000 years ago .. as well as the basins , a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered .. dr barken said : ` this is also the northernmost evidence we have of an egyptian presence in the early bronze age .. ` until now we were only aware of an egyptian presence in the northern negev and southern coastal plain , whereby the northernmost point of egyptian occupation occurred in azor .. fragments of pottery that are around 5,000 years old and were used by ancient egyptians to make beer , have been discovered on a building site in tel aviv .. here , diego barkan holds the basin parts. employees of the israel antiquities authority ( pictured ) work at the site in tel aviv where fragments of pottery used by ancient egyptians have been discovered .. a total of 17 pits have revealed finds. as well as the basins , which were pulled from pits in the centre of tel aviv ( pictured left ) a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered .. a flint blade is pictured right. last year , the tomb of a leading ancient egyptian beer brewer was discovered .. the tomb of khonso em heb , who lived 3,200 years ago , was found by a japanese team and has been been described as ` one of the most important discoveries ' made at the thebes necropolic site in the city of luxor .. egypt 's antiquities minister mohamed ibrahim described khonso em heb as the chief ` maker of beer for gods of the dead ' .. he was thought to be the head of a warehouse and judging by the decorations in his tomb was an important and wealthy man .. the walls of the tomb contain paintings showing everyday life and rituals .. ` now we know that they also appreciated what the tel aviv region had to offer and that they too knew how to enjoy a glass of beer , just as tel avivians do today ' .. according to the antiquities authority , ` beer was the egyptian national drink and was a staple along with bread .

hometown boy jimmy walker held his nerve to close out victory at the valero texas open at tpc san antonio .. the ryder cup player added to his sony open title this season and three pga tour victories in 2014 as a closing 70 maintained his four-shot overnight lead .. jordan spieth was second on seven under , having perhaps left his run too late before finishing with four birdies in the last five holes .. jimmy walker poses with the valero texas open trophy after recording a four-shot win. walker took the trophy at his hometown tournament and now has six wins since the start of 2014. walker went into his final round with four-shot lead and managed to preserve his advantage. walker birdied the par-five second when he laid up short of the green , pitched on and holed a straight eight-foot putt - though he gave the shot back at the fourth .. another bogey at the seventh was off-set as he pitched stone-dead from an awkward bunker stance at the next , and he birdied 10 as well before dropping a shot at 12 .. playing partner spieth made a late bid to exert some pressure with birdies at the 14th - via a 45-foot putt - and 15th and when his tee shot at the showpiece 16th spun back out of the fringe , there was scope for walker to crack .. instead , the san antonio resident struck a lovely pin-high tee shot and read the left-to-right break to perfection on the ensuing 16-foot putt .. his birdie was matched by spieth but the four-shot margin remained and despite a poor tee shot , walker also birdied the penultimate hole with a good putt from 18 feet .. spieth did likewise and both parred the last to leave walker as the tour 's first repeat winner this season .. he told nbc : ` it 's at home and it 's cool , you can feel support of friends , family and fans .. it does n't happen often , to win in your home town .. ` it played hard today , sometimes it 's hard to make pars .. i was n't putting very good but i finally got the putting stroke smoothed out and holed a couple .. ` and jordan ... holy cow !. i 'll be having nightmares about that guy !

'. billy horschel , the third player in the group , finished third outright at four under .. chesson hadley birdied the last hole to finish joint fourth with daniel summerhays at three under .. several players went into the tournament with hopes of breaking into the world 's top 50 and qualifying for the masters , but none were able to produce the finish they required .
england are the embarrassment of the world cup after a third humiliating defeat in three matches against australia , new zealand and sri lanka .. sportsmail 's panel of experts -- nasser hussain , david lloyd , cricket correspondent paul newman and cricket writer and wisden editor lawrence booth -- discuss the big questions arising from another world cup failure .. england captain eoin morgan plays a shot during the world cup match against sri lanka in wellington. england gary ballance ( front ) loses his wicket to sri lanka 's tillakaratne dilshan during the world cup match. is there any hope left for england at this world cup ?. nasser hussain : if there is , it 's because of the ridiculous format of this tournament .. they should beat bangladesh and afghanistan , but the best we can hope for is some one-off brilliance in the quarter-final .. paul newman : you would think not and yet the flawed format still gives them every chance of facing india , a team they have beaten in their past two meetings , in a quarter-final in melbourne .. that should not be possible after the way england have stunk the tournament out .. lawrence booth : the bare minimum for them was a quarter-final .. now , if either bangladesh or afghanistan have a good day , they may not even make that .. they 've had four years to prepare , yet look further off the pace than ever .. david lloyd : realistically , no .. it 's sad to see so much effort going into plans and strategy that just do not fit in modern international cricket .. i 've never seen a team leave the ball so much in the one-day game .. if there 's any width other teams just whack it .. joe root bats for england during their match against sri lanka at wellington regional stadium. england have slumped to three straight world cup defeats against australia , new zealand and sri lanka. can anything be done in the short-term ?. hussain : they need variety in their bowling , and a more attacking no 3 .. if they get through to a quarter-final on a drop-in wicket against india or south africa , four 85mph right-arm seamers are n't going to surprise anyone .. ravi bopara offers something different , and tredwell is england 's best off-spinner .. and i 'd get hales in for ballance .. newman : they must play alex hales .. gary ballance should not be learning the ropes in the biggest limited-overs tournament of all .. england just do not seem to rate hales and if that is the case what is he doing here ?. if he does not play in adelaide on monday they might as well send him home .. and get jos buttler in earlier .. leaving him just 19 balls against sri lanka was criminal .. booth : they 've got to stop going on about stats , which mean little in the new era of fielding restrictions , and go for broke with players who scare the opposition .. they should also pick their best spinner , james tredwell , because four right-arm seamers are n't doing the job .. lloyd : hales can be brought in but do n't expect him to start blasting it .. if he was a success from the word go it would be a bonus .. so many people in the game say he should have been in the 50-over team for the past 18 months !. england batsman jos buttler ducks a delivery against sri lanka at the wellington regional stadium. sri lanka batsman lahiru thirimanne ( left ) dives to make his crease just in time against england. and what about the long-term ?. hussain : there 's no easy fix .. but i wish selectors would show faith in their one-day players like in test cricket : look at how they backed joe root .. give hales 20 one - dayers to see what he 's made of .. newman : rip it up and start again .. england need to work towards as separate a one-day team as possible , leaving jimmy anderson and stuart broad , to name two , to focus on tests .. bring in the likes of sam billings , jason roy and ben stokes and keep them together , ideally under a different coach working on modern limited-overs skills .. perhaps paul farbrace , who won the asia cup and world t20 with sri lanka , could step up while peter moores concentrates on tests .. i know split coaches did n't work last time but england prioritised test cricket then .. they have to give equal billing to 50 and 20-over cricket from now .. booth : england have to accept , finally , that the game has changed , and back more youngsters -- the likes of roy and james vince .. but the problem runs deeper : england is inherently a test nation .. until they take 50-over cricket seriously , they 'll always flop at world cups .. lloyd : england need to show imagination in selection .. think about the words ` dynamic ' and ` power ' and pick the team accordingly .. i 'll throw in three names : stokes , roy and adil rashid .. i 'd implore england to look at how other teams are doing it -- people like aussie glenn maxwell , corey anderson of new zealand and the dynamic australian duo of david warner and aaron finch .. they show absolutely no fear at all .. sam billings ( pictured in january 2015 ) has been backed by paul newman to help reinvent the england set-up. 24-year-old jason roy ( pictured playing for surrey in june 2014 ) , is another name being mooted for england. what do you think of eoin morgan as captain ?. hussain : i 've been disappointed with the way he 's become infected with management-speak .. here 's a player whose flair and inventiveness made him what he is .. instead , he 's talking about statistics .. but you do need a plan , and a captain 's only as good as his bowling attack .. newman : disappointing so far .. still looks out of form with the bat , has n't been the pro-active , imaginative leader we hoped and seems to be in denial .. he should be criticised for playing in the ipl rather than leading england against ireland in may .. if he does n't want the captaincy , give it to root .. booth : he has a bit more about him tactically than alastair cook .. morgan was given just the tri-series in australia to prepare .. what did the ecb expect ?. lloyd : i like morgan immensely but i shudder at the interviews he 's giving .. he 's just talking statistics all the time !. forget stats -- if we 've got the players to make an impact , let them play in a different style , on instinct .. he must also show more imagination in the field .. morgan 's form for england has come under particular scrutiny during england 's woeful world cup campaign. does moores still have much to prove as coach ?. hussain : yes , lots .. he 's partly a victim of england 's one-day struggles , but it 's a worry to see some players going backwards .. turning round the test series against india was to his credit , but he 'll be judged on the rest of this world cup and the ashes later this year .. newman : i so want him to succeed , but there are worrying signs he looks out of his depth at international level .. the players seem to like and respect him but he does not seem to be inspiring them .. booth : he has everything to prove .. he was lucky to be re-appointed and results have mainly been poor .. he inherited a shambles but at some point that stops being relevant .. lloyd : peter is ageing by the day .. i hope he is looking at what other coaches like darren lehmann and mike hesson are doing with australia and new zealand .. do n't have any regard for reputations -- swing from the hip .. england 's disappointing world cup has raised questions over the future of coach peter moores. can kevin pietersen really play for england again ?. hussain : i 've always believed in picking the best side , then man-managing it .. but i feel there 's too much baggage with kp now .. also , he 's not the player he once was .. if he was 24 , rather than 34 , you might give him another go .. but the focus should be on england 's one-day team , not pietersen .. newman : well , what a can of worms incoming ecb chairman colin graves opened .. the suggestion is that nothing has changed regarding pietersen but graves ' clumsy words undermined the management while the ecb 's attempt to distance themselves from his comments by talking about ` positive influences ' just made it worse .. booth : would he really have saved england at the world cup ?. he played nine odis in 2013 and averaged 28 .. and he 'll be 35 soon .. i loved watching him , but let 's not pretend he 's a panacea .. lloyd : if it is going to happen kevin must be playing county cricket -- red-ball and white-ball .. if he commits to the english game and scores heavily then he should be back in the mix .. whether or not kevin pietersen should return to the england set-up remains a hotly contested debate. sportsmail experts are skeptical that 34-year-old pietersen 's return would necessarily improve england

ever thought about switching your tampons for something a little more ... sustainable ?. since the menstrual cup - a reusable silicone cup that collects menstrual fluid - is rarely advertised , most women find themselves reluctant to try it .. writing for healthista.com , i gave the mooncup ( or mcuk , as it is known in the us ) a try - to work out what it is , how to use it , and what it actually feels like .. warning : this is one graphic blog .. if you are of the male persuasion , it 's best you move on , because i 'm going to be talking about ( gasp ) menstruation .. specifically , menstrual cups which collect menstrual fluid , unlike tampons and sanitary pads that absorb it .. the mooncup ( or mcuk , as it is known in the us ) is a reusable silicone cup that collects menstrual fluid. what draws most women to re-usable menstrual cups is that they are economical , eco-friendly and more comfortable as they do n't cause dryness or irritation - a common bugbear of tampon users .. ` i just feel better about having a mooncup in my body than i do a tampon , ' one menstrual cup devotee told me .. menstrual cups are n't new - they were patented in 1932 by a group of u.s. midwives .. but not many women use them or even know about them - perhaps due to the fact that menstrual cups are n't widely promoted -- or sold .. conglomerates such as procter & gamble are unlikely to throw big money into a product that only sells once every five years , when they can sell multiple products to one woman every month .. mother-of-four genny wilkinson-priest says she was initially sceptical about menstrual cups - but was surprised at how effective hers was. with the global tampon market projected to top $ 2.6 billion in 2015 , according to market research firm global industry analysts , why would they put their money anywhere else ?. there are many menstrual cup brands on the market - the femmecup , the diva cup , the intimina and more .. i tried the # 18 ( $ 27.50 ) mooncup , which like most menstrual cups comes in two sizes : one for women who have given birth before , and one for women who have n't or are under 30 years of age .. this struck one friend as slightly odd : ` i was 29 when i tried the mooncup , which made me rather concerned as to what the hell was going to happen to my vagina on my 30th birthday ?. ` was it going to expand that much ? '. when i first opened the package and saw the mooncup , i thought no freaking way am i putting that up my hoo-ha .. and then i remembered i 've given birth multiple times .. if i can push a 7lb baby out four times in a five year period , surely i can handle a squishy piece of latex that 's two inches in diameter. when i first opened the package , i thought no freaking way am i putting that up my hoo-ha .. whether or not you 've had a baby , it 's dead easy - you fold the latex cup in half , then in half again .. at that point it 's only slightly bigger than a tampon and a whole lot more malleable .. inserting the mooncup was a lot easier than i thought .. it should sit low in the vagina , with the tip of it sitting just outside your body .. this took some getting used to as a tampon is inserted higher up in the vagina toward the cervix .. getting it out however , was another matter .. i 've heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it 's the new toy of vintage-shopping , tree-hugging , flat-white drinking , vegan hipster , ' says ginny .. this is n't a political statement '. the mooncup has a tendency to migrate upwards - especially if you inserted it too far up to begin with .. if this happens , you have to do a fair bit of rooting around to pull the darn thing out .. using what is essentially a suction cup is a much more hands-on experience than using a tampon or pad .. a handful of women i spoke to said they found menstrual cups uncomfortable with the edges of the cup digging into their vaginal wall .. ` i spent the day walking like a duck .. my friends knew when i was on as i would sit in a slightly odd manner , ' said one .. this , however , was n't my experience .. you can leave a menstrual cup in for up to eight hours - that 's handy for overnight use .. when it 's time to change , you just tip the fluid into a sink and wash it out before re-inserting .. many women i spoke to said this was one of the most fascinating aspects of a menstrual cup -- you can actually see how much you bleed ( the mooncup is marked with measurements ! ). while some women might be put off from witnessing their period up close and personal like this , i found it connected me closer to my body .. i felt as if i was more fully experiencing an aspect of my womanhood that i had in the past treated as a nuisance .. for some women , it 's a matter of safeguarding their sense of what makes them a woman .. ` what draws most women to re-usable menstrual cups is that they are economical , eco-friendly and more comfortable as they do n't cause dryness or irritation - a common bugbear of tampon users , ' says ginny. as one friend said , ` after having a baby , something makes me want to protect my vagina more vigilantly , so i do n't want to put anything up there that could be potentially hazardous to my feminine health . '. as a life-long user of tampons i was distrustful of the mooncup .. but there was never a problem .. so , does it actually work ?. i was a bit fearful of leaks at first ; as a life-long user of tampons i was distrustful of the mooncup .. but there was never a problem .. i went swimming with it , i did dynamic yoga with it ( think splits and handstands ) , and i went to the movies with it .. i am a convert , even as the mooncup took a fair bit of getting used to .. i 'll probably supplement the mooncup with tampons when i 'm traveling , or on a night out when i know there will be no private sink to sort out your business .. some women i spoke to said they bring a bottle of water into a public toilet in order to clean out their menstrual cup but this strikes me as more trouble than it 's worth .. i 've heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it 's the new toy of vintage-shopping , tree-hugging , flat-white drinking , vegan hipsters .. this is n't a political statement .. it 's just a feminine hygiene product .. one that works , too .. genny wilkinson-priest is a yoga teacher and journalist who lives in london with her four sons .

compare and contrast these two manager quotes about danny welbeck from this season .. the uncompromising louis van gaal , asked in november whether he still thought it was a good idea to sell the in-form welbeck to arsenal on deadline day , said : ' i do n't have to prove that [ i was right ] .. ` why do i have to prove that ?. i have already said what i think - he was not a line-up player , he was more a substitute than a line-up player .. danny welbeck trains ahead of his return to manchester united with arsenal in the fa cup sixth round. the england striker has been reduced to a bit-part role in recent weeks , spending time on the bench. louis van gaal wrote welbeck off as not good enough for the manchester united first team. ` he was already , with different coaches , not a line-up player , but then with mr van gaal , the world is changing ?. no the world is not changing .. they are not my facts , they are the facts of danny welbeck . '. and arsene wenger , speaking on the impact of welbeck just the other day : ` he 's very important and has played many , many games since the start of the season . '. i think he 's played in nearly every single game .. his position is one of the three up front , central , left or right .. he can play anywhere . '. so welbeck has apparently gone from a condemned man at manchester united , destined to rot away on the bench , to a versatile and indispensable part of arsenal 's team .. but , as the england striker returns to old trafford for the first time for monday night 's crunch fa cup sixth-round tie , has he actually fared that well at the emirates ?. welbeck celebrates a goal for manchester united against west ham under david moyes last season. welbeck was given a chance to impress on united 's pre-season tour of the united states. well , at the time of van gaal 's outburst , just ahead of united 's away match with arsenal on november 22 , he had every reason to be tetchy .. while united had endured their worst start to a season in living memory , welbeck had made light of his # 16m transfer fee .. given regular football by wenger at the head of arsenal 's attack , he looked revitalised , a player brimming with confidence who looked on course to score 20 goals this season for his new team .. just days after his move , welbeck scored two for england in their 2-0 european qualifying win in switzerland , before he opened his gunners account in a 3-0 win at aston villa .. the highlight was a hat-trick in arsenal 's 4-1 champions league win over galatasaray , a performance praised by wenger as ` electric ' .. arsene wenger was thrilled with welbeck 's early performances in an arsenal shirt. welbeck 's best performance in an arsenal shirt was a hat-trick against galatasaray in the champions league. welbeck pictured here completing his treble against the turkish side at the emirates back in october. at that point , it was all looking very awkward for van gaal .. events since then have made him feel a little better , if not entirely vindicated .. welbeck has scored just three more goals for arsenal since the galatasaray match .. there have been mitigating circumstances though .. welbeck suffered a thigh injury and missed the whole of january , his absence coinciding with a return to form for olivier giroud .. by the time welbeck had rediscovered his fitness , wenger found it very difficult to take the frenchman out of the forward position .. so welbeck 's versatility has become something of a curse .. when he plays , he is stuck out on the wing , a position he is less effective in .. when he left for north london , he said : ' i prefer to play through the middle .. once i get into the box and am getting the chances , i have got faith in my ability . '. and , at this pivotal stage of the season , his game time has dried up as well .. arsenal are prospering without him .. welbeck 's # 16m move to arsenal led to a resurgence in form for england too. welbeck 's last goal for the gunners came in the win over west ham just after christmas. welbeck was left on the bench during the win over leicester and he was brought on for mere cameos in the wins over everton and queens park rangers .. so the 24-year-old returns to old trafford with plenty to prove .. he believed arsenal was a club that would advance his career but evidence of this has so far been in short supply .. however , earning champions league qualification and winning the fa cup for arsenal - the two things van gaal craves so dearly this season - would certainly make him feel better .
there are a million women who would n't mind swapping places with sarah greene .. unlike the rest of the nation 's females , aidan turner 's beautiful irish girlfriend is lucky enough to enjoy the smouldering poldark star for real .. the 29-year-old actress may not yet be a household name but she 's also a long way off being just turner 's squeeze with a blossoming acting career of her own .. they are very much a couple whose stars are in the ascendant .. a very aspiring couple : poldark star aidan turner , 31 , with his girlfriend , 29-year-old actress sarah greene. behind every brooding man : the couple have been together for four years and have weathered working apart for their careers .. they say skype has helped .... and he is clearly smitten with his girlfriend of four years .. in an interview with the sunday times this weekend , the 31-year-old irishman says that while many couples , particularly those in the limelight , might have seen their relationship foundering under the pressure of work commitments , they did n't have that problem .. ` you meet someone , you fall in love , then you can only see them over skype or phone calls or texts and emails .. and you have this whole other side to your relationship and it 's ... it was fun .. he continues : ` we knew we really wanted to be together .. and knew if we could do that , we could tackle a lot more .. it was never : god , this is hard , bloody hell , we need to review this .. we never questioned it ; it was great .. so we had that from the beginning ... '. early on in the couple 's relationship , greene painted a similar picture , previously admitting to the irish times that they are both resigned to periods apart : ` well , that 's the job we do .. we 'll always travel with work .. skype is great , and we 're getting on brilliantly .. ` it 's been actually quite easy because we 're both working .. if i was n't working it would be a lot harder . '. irish eyes : greene , who was born in cork , starred opposite daniel radcliffe in the cripple of innishmaan and was nominated for both a laurence olivier award and a tony award for her performance. so , who exactly is sarah greene and how did she successfully woo the man that is currently capturing millions of hearts while playing cornish legend captain ross poldark in the hit bbc series ?. to date , the cork-born actress is best known for playing opposite harry potter star daniel radcliffe in the cripple of inishmaan .. greene played the role of helen mccormick in the play and trod the boards in the london production in 2013 before transferring to broadway the following year .. it was a role that garnered plenty of praise from critics ; nominations for laurance olivier and tony awards followed .. the actress is currently starring in penny dreadful , a dublin-based sky atlantic horror show about the cheap-to-buy , sensationalist books of the same name which were published in the 19th century .. turner has admitted to using baby oil to make his body look perfect on screen. although the poldark star has said he had to seriously hit the gym to perfectly hone his physique , the make-up department had another trick to ensure his body looked suitably granite-like for the hit bbc show .. turner says that some kind of ` baby oil ' was used to make his muscles ripple perfectly for the camera .. and captain poldark 's striking eyes might suggest turners ' own peepers were enhanced with make-up but that 's not the case .. he told the times that while he had to wear eyeliner for ` some scenes ' , he definitely does n't lush up his lashes with mascara .. a role in the canadian-irish television series vikings also raised the irish beauty 's profile and it seems hollywood now beckons too .. later this year , the striking brunette is set to start work on a comedy , playing opposite bradley cooper and sienna miller .. born in cork , greene trained in dublin , graduating from the gaiety school of acting in 2006 after becoming obsessed with being an actress after going to watch a local panto .. she said : ` my parents took myself and my sister to see the christmas panto red riding hood in the cork opera house and i was sold , all i wanted to do was get up on the stage ! '. the couple met after working together in the play titus andronicus but it was a slow burn before a relationship developed .. he told irish weekend magazine in 2013 : ' i did a play with her about eight years ago titus andronicus , directed by selina cartmell . '. i played demetrius , her character was n't a named character but we met on that .. ` it was all very platonic and we never hooked up or anything , but that 's how we got to know each other .. and then years later we just met again and it just sort of took off . '. his brooding good looks are n't always so refined either .. the actor has confessed that he is ` inherently lazy ' and only really got in shape for poldark as filming start dates approached . '. i worked hard for six weeks , killing myself in the gym , watching what i eat and staying away from bad food .. but i would never , ever do all that if i was n't prepping for a role .. that 's the only time it just happens , ' he explained .. ` i 'm not like that now .. i 'm back to my usual soft self . '. it has n't always been plain sailing on the love front either .. speaking to the daily mirror about being hurt by a past girlfriend , the actor said : ` yes , it 's happened to me .. i 've been upset , my heart 's been broken . '. i do n't know anyone on the planet who has n't had their heart broken .. ` it 's the purest and rawest thing we have in life and everyone experiences it . '. he may have found happiness with greene , but talks of engagement are too hasty .. last week , she told irish entertainment websites and goss.ie and evoke.ie while at an event in dublin : ` i 'm not engaged .

a terror attack in britain is a ` price we should be willing to pay ' if it means spy agencies do not have access to masses of personal data , a human rights group has claimed .. isabella sankey , liberty 's director of policy , said it was better to let ` some things happen ' than to give security services ` privacy-infringing measures ' designed to catch extremists plotting atrocities in the uk and overseas .. the claim that privacy should be put before national security was condemned as ` unacceptable ' as a report revealed the extent of snooping by gchq .. relatives of victims killed in the london terror attacks in 2005 said liberty was ` isolated from the real world ' after suggesting allowing some preventable attacks to happen was a price worth paying. liberty , which campaigns on civil liberties and human rights issues , was at the forefront of the criticisms of the security and intelligence services when the claims from whistle-blower edward snowden broke in june 2013 .. parliament 's intelligence and security committee found that agents at gchq , the government listening post , monitor ` large numbers of items ' using ` bulk interception ' powers to uncover terror threats .. but the committee dismissed the claims that gchq had ` blanket coverage ' of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages .. it said gchq can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ` tiny fraction ' of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process .. isabella sankey , liberty 's director of policy , said some terror attacks succeeding was a ` price we should be willing to pay ' rather than have gchq use ` bulk collection ' techniques. but this probably still means that thousands of texts , emails and facebook messages are read every day by government spies .. privacy campaigners argue the security services already have too much power to gather and read personal communications .. giving evidence on behalf of liberty , miss sankey was asked by the committee in october if she opposed bulk collection even if it was used in a ` targeted ' way to ` prevent plots and contribute to national security ' .. such techniques were , she said , wrong ` in principle ' and could not be justified even if they were lawful and authorised .. she added : ` some things might happen that could have been prevented if you took all of the most oppressive , restrictive and privacy-infringing measures .. that is the price you pay to live in a free society . '. her claims were backed by privacy campaign group big brother watch .. but the isc said : ` we do not subscribe to the point of view that it is acceptable to let some terrorist attacks happen to uphold the individual right to privacy -- nor do we believe that the vast majority of the british public would . '. labour mp hazel blears , a member of the intelligence and security committee branded liberty 's views ` unacceptable ' .. pointing to the comments , ms blears said : ` their view was even if terrorist plots happened they were not prepared to allow this capability to collect information whereas that 's not a view we take . '. ` the public will want to see they have that capability but absolutely constrained by a proper legal framework .. ` to not have the capability you 're going to accept that some plots will happen and innocent people will lose their lives because you do not want agencies to have this capability .. i think it 's unacceptable . '. labour mp hazel blears said it was ` unacceptable ' to suggest capability should not be used to prevent a terror attack. the isc report was ordered in the wake of when the claims from whistle-blower edward snowden broke in june 2013. the long-awaited report into britain 's spy agencies blanks out almost every detail which would reveal the true extent of the government 's state snooping programme .. the report reveals there are around 100,000 ` bearers ' -- or underwater cables -- which transmit information over the internet .. all of these cables - carrying people 's emails , facebook messages and other communications - can potentially be hacked by gchq , the committee reveals .. but only a small percentage are actually accessed by britain 's spies , the report says .. the committee also blanks out the exact percentage of information accessed off these chosen cables every day .. it says only a ` tiny fraction ' of the billions of items that are sent over the internet on a daily basis are snooped on .. the report says : ` only the communications of suspected criminals or national security targets are deliberately selected for examination . '. it says : ` fewer than *** of *** per cent of the items that transit the internet in one day are ever selected to be read by a gchq analyst . '. the report says ` around *** thousand items a day ' are read by the spooks .. these are ` only the ones considered to be of the highest intelligence value ' , the report adds .. amnesty international said the report could ` absolutely no way be considered adequate ' .. yesterday miss sankey accused the committee of attempting to put words in her mouth .. she said : ` instead of attempting to put words into the mouths of privacy campaigners , the isc should have put its efforts into scrutinising the agencies .. ` there is absolutely no excuse for terrorism and society must take all proportional steps to deal with it -- but the real story here is that , despite their best efforts , the committee has been unable to present any evidence that mass surveillance of innocents ' calls and emails is saving any lives . '. graham foulkes , whose son david , 22 , was killed in the 2005 london bombings , told the times : ` the question that should be asked is , what 's the minimum interference in our freedom that gives us maximum protection ?. ` liberty is isolated from the real world .. because it is so lauded and courted by politicians , it has lost sense of what it 's all about . ". the committee 's 18-month inquiry said britain 's spy agencies were not breaking the law -- but called for a complete overhaul of the rules governing what they were allowed to do in the interests of national security .. the report says a single law is needed to keep in check the powers of the intelligence agencies to snoop on private communications , because the current legal framework governing the likes of gchq , mi5 and mi6 is ` unnecessarily complicated ' and ` lacks transparency ' .. human rights and civil liberties groups dismissed today 's report as a whitewash and accused the committee of being ' a mouthpiece for the spooks ' .. shami chakrabarti , director of rights campaign group liberty , said : ` the isc has repeatedly shown itself as - so clueless and ineffective that it 's only thanks to edward snowden that it had the slightest clue of the agencies ' antics .. ` the committee calls this report a landmark for ` openness and transparency ' - but how do we trust agencies who have acted unlawfully , hacked the world 's largest sim card manufacturer and developed technologies capable of collecting our login details and passwords , manipulating our mobile devices and hacking our computers and webcams ? '. rachel logan , amnesty uk 's legal programme director , said : ` the oversight of the security services should be the responsibility of a properly independent body .. ` the prime minister holds a veto over who sits on the isc , what it can examine , and what it can report so there is absolutely no way it can be considered an adequate independent regulator of the activities of our spies . '. open rights group executive director jim killock added : ` the isc should have apologised to the nation for their failure to inform parliament about how far gchq 's powers have grown .. ` this report fails to address any of the key questions apart from the need to reform our out-of-date surveillance laws .. this just confirms that the isc lacks the sufficient independence and expertise to hold the agencies to account .

'. to cook food , cinder has an enclosed chamber and two non-stick aluminium cooking plates .. these are equipped with highly accurate sensors that achieve and maintain the precise temperature to cook a particular food .. this can either be calculated by the machine , or selected according to the cook 's preferences .. the company said it can ` prepare a perfect , medium-rare new york strip steak , cooked evenly edge-to-edge and with a beautiful seared exterior , in 28 minutes . '. the user selects what food is cooking via an app .. the device then uses two plates to heat it to the right temperature .. it can also store cooked food for up to two hours ready to serve. the app will send you reminders to let you know when your food is done and the user can also control the cooker remotely using any connected device .. it is currently only available for ios. to cook food in cinder , the user simply places the food inside and closes the lid .. they then select what they are cooking - for example ` ny strip , medium rare ' - in an accompanying app .. it reaches its target temperature ` within seconds ' and then maintains this until the food also reaches its correct temperature .. once cooked , the machine can then keep the food at its serving temperature for two hours .. ` because the temperature inside cinder is so precise and remains constant , it is impossible to overcook or undercook the steak , ' the company claimed .. ` to monitor the temperature of the food , cinder uses a ` patent-pending virtual-thermometer algorithm . '. cinder is available now for pre-order , and will begin shipping in early 2016 .. mr norman said the product enables people to ` combine the best parts of home cooking - the creative and sensory experience - with the best part of fine dining , which is the perfectly cooked , delicious food '. the # 330 ( $ 499 ) cinder sensing cooker ( shown ) looks like a sandwich toaster but is instead used to cook a variety foods including steak and salmon .. it will be available in early 2016

kim kardashian and rita ora have been making headlines for rocking latex this year but they 're not the first - and the wo n't be the last - to show off the risque look .. once the sartorial statement of choice in sex clubs , latex , pvc and wet-look leather has been treated to a high fashion makeover but can real women pull off the skin-tight look ?. or do you need the body - and the confidence - of an a-lister to wear it ?. femail called on the designer behind kim and rita 's famous looks to custom design a latex dress from scratch for one of our writers - who says she 's never felt more confident .. can anyone pull off latex like kim kardashian ?. mailonline writer hanna flint had a dress custom-made by the star 's favourite designer , atsuko kudo , and she felt ` amazing ' in her showstopping outfit. kim kardashian wore her kudo latex dress in september and hanna had her own version custom made to prove that you do n't have to be a megastar to rock the risque fabric. from kate moss to dita von teese , atsuko kudo has designed latex outfits for a who 's who of showbiz and kim just ca n't get enough of the skin-tight looks .. plus , judging by the catwalks at fashion week , it will be filling our wardrobes in months to come , so hanna flint , our 26-year-old writer , was in safe hands .. hanna , who is a size 12 , visited atsuko 's studio in islington , north london , for a fitting - as while her designs can be bought off the rack ( something rita ora does ) , atsuko recommends that she fits all of her clients either in person or online .. after being measured , hanna tried on a variety of colours - from peach to black - and differing styles , to see which she felt most comfortable in .. ` it 's a really personal experience , ' explains the brand 's managing director , simon hoare .. ` latex is perfect for a special moment and it 's all about feeling and looking great in it .. you have to commit to putting in the time to get a fitting so that the final outfit looks like it 's painted on . '. hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch and had to use lubricant to slip into the dress for the final shoot. hanna said that maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket , she could reduce the focus of her top half for a night out on the town. hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch .. the process involves gluing the latex together to the customer 's precise measurements and requirements .. explaining the experience , hanna said : ` at the fitting , atsuko and the team brought out a few options for me to try , but at first they did n't take my measurements rather took a look at me and gauged which size would fit .. ` clearly they have a good eye for it as the dresses actually fitted very well on the body , though they had to make my bust size and cup bigger ( just like kim ! ). i definitely needed a hand putting on the dress , and the stylist put talc on the inside of the dress so it could slip on better .. i say slip , but that was n't the case as there was a lot of pulling and squeezing to make sure the seams were lined up and there was n't any ridges in the latex .. ` once i stepped out and saw myself i had to admit , it was a pretty " wow " moment .. i do have some lumps and bumps but the dress really streamlined it and i really get why kim is such a fan .. i actually really liked the black dress with the plunging neckline , because as a woman with a bust , it 's hard to wear that sort of cut without accidentally suffering a nipple slip !. thanks to the tight latex there was no danger of that .. ` it 's amazing how 15 minutes in the dress can become rather hot work and after trying on three , i did feel thoroughly flushed .. hats off to ella eyre who rocked an atsuko kudo latex dress for her energetic concert recently ! '. atsuko kudo takes hanna 's measurements in her islington boutique. writer hanna is proof that you do n't have to be a reality star or celebrity to look sensational - and super stylish - in skintight latex. and a few days later , hanna received her bespoke design .. ` finally putting on the custom-made dress was amazing , ' said hanna , of the final shoot .. ` it fitted perfectly to my shape and bust size but i would probably need a hand to get it on in the first place - and maybe when i visit the ladies ' room .. ` the great thing about the latex is that once it 's in position , it does streamline your figure .. ` kim probably has more confidence to wear such a cleavage-enhancing dress on the town than me , but maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket i could reduce the focus of my top half for a night out . '. i probably would n't wear it to go dancing in .. it does get a little hot under the latex and i doubt kim would be seen with a sweat on . '. while hanna opted for a copy kim look , atsuko emphasises that you do n't necessarily have to wear head-to-toe latex .. she said : ' i make accessories , millinery , shorts and skirts so you can mix and match . '. atsuko first discovered the fabric when she was at fashion college in japan 20 years ago .. she was tasked with finding a quirky material on the high street and ventured into a sex shop and from that day made it her mission to create clothes using latex .. hanna , 26 , tries out a skintight latex cocktail dress with cap sleeves and plunging v-neck in atsuko 's shop. hanna is measured for her bespoke , strappy , cleavage-enhancing latex dress , which is just like kim 's. after moving to london , she started brand her eponymous brand in 2000 and was credited with being the first designer to offer a feminine take on latex .. her work quickly got picked up by dita von teese and iconic photographer steven meisel used four pages of eva mendes wearing the fabric in italian vogue in 2007 .. ` that was such a moment , ' recalled simon .. ` it looked so great and sexy on her ; that was the real turning point . '. other stars were quickly recognising the brand and atsuko was dressing lady gaga non-stop from 2008 .. atsuko dressed her when she was supporting the pussy cat dolls on tour , as well as for most of her music videos , including telephone with beyonce , who she also dressed .. kim kardashian and rita ora showed up to a party earlier this year in near-identical latex dresses by atsuko kudo ... and they 're just two of the stars jumping on the bandwagon. hanna tried on rita and kim 's favourite blush-coloured latex shade too at the shop before finally settling on the black option , which better suited her skin tone and hair colour. another major moment came when for the brand when lady gaga asked atsuko to dress her for her meeting with the queen , who the designer cites as her ` dream client ' . '. i would love to dress the queen in a latex suit , a colourful one - with a hat . '. on a standard week day , kate moss and rita ora may ` rock up ' at the brand 's shop in islington , and kim may well be unveiling more looks in the coming months .. simon said : ` she tends to save her latex looks for special moments .. it divides opinion but , overall , because kim is so curvy , it has made a lot of curvier women think " if she is wearing it , then i am going to give it a go " .. ` she is the first iconic figure for some time in fashion who has had real curves .. and kanye certainly likes her in it . '. kim has long championed the material and made headlines when she wore a look by same the designer back in november for a fragrance launch in australia , left , and to watch husband kanye perform , right. mrs kanye west is n't the only celebrity to wear atsko kudo designs : the elaborate red dress lady gaga wore to meet queen elizabeth in 2009 was created by the designer. ella eyre wore one of the designs on stage at her recent gig - and proved you can jump around in it. sarah , duchess of york , left , kate moss , centre , and singer charli xcx , right , have all trailed the trend ( although some looks are more daring than others )

it is a pioneer of ` affordable luxury ' .. but the expected price tag on one of apple 's new watches is far from wallet-friendly .. at $ 10,000 , the 18-carat gold , sapphire and crystal apple watch edition being launched on monday would be the firm 's most expensive product since the $ 10,000 lisa computer in 1983 , developed by steve jobs , which was poorly received .. it is the first new innovation to come from apple since jobs died in 2011 , and will be unveiled by chief executive tim cook on monday .. analysts have branded the move a clear attempt to segway into asia 's booming luxury goods market - and suggest it could be the start of an entirely new market .. luxury : the apple watch edition is 18-carat gold , sapphire and crystal , priced at a reported $ 10,000. ` elegant curve ' : a luxury goods analyst for sotheby 's said the design looks promising as a high-end product. launch : tim cook will unveil the new apple watch edition , plus two others , on monday. ` apple is the only technology brand that has the potential to move from tech brand to luxury brand .. this is unprecedented , ' jan dawson , chief technology analyst for jackdaw research , told dailymail.com . '. i think this is apple flexing its muscles , moving into a space that it potentially has all to itself .. ` the question is : how big is that market ?. is apple eating into the market or making it bigger ? '. i think they will make it grow . '. cook is expected to explain in detail how customers will use the buttons on the side of the device to operate the apps on the screen like an iphone .. at the other end of the spectrum , customers can opt for a midrange watch or an ` entry-level ' watch sport , starting at $ 349 - a fraction of most watch prices on the market .. tag heuer 's monaco men 's watch will set shoppers back $ 72,000 .. the rolex gmt-master ii mens automatic watch costs an eye-watering $ 373,720 .. the move into this market comes months after apple poached burberry 's ceo angela ahrendts to be the new senior vice president of retail and sales - and lend a fashionable eye .. alongside yves saint laurent 's paul deneve , as a ` special projects ' vice president , and designer marc newson , as a part-time consultant , the team has masterminded the firm 's unprecedented move .. big move : the products will be the first new innovations to come from apple since steve jobs died in 2011. wearables : analysts say the shift into wearables will be a major breakthrough for the firm targeting china. in october , a prototype of the edition watch even appeared at paris fashion week .. however , some have speculated that without a solid grounding in the high-end retail market , the apple edition watch could suffer the same flaws as most iphones , which cease to efficiently function after a few years .. but according to thomaï serdari , luxury brand strategist and lecturer at sotheby 's institute of art in new york , the details of the edition model that have been released look promising .. she told dailymail.com : ` apple produces good design , and i hate to say it but good design is priceless .. ` from what i have seen , the gold watch has a very elegant profile .. the very slight curve shows that the design has been very well studied to fit on your wrist .. i am curious to see how it actually feels . '. i would n't be surprised if customers have the option of keeping the strap and the casing but updating the software , which would create loyalty and longevity . '. serdari , who also lectures on product and fashion design at nyu , notes that apple is following the classic launch strategy of designer brands like chanel , which uses pricing to carve a position in the market .. ` chanel targets a broad market and in order to maintain the air of luxury increases the prices often very steeply .. shoe-in : apple poached burberry 's ceo angela ahrendts to help make a play for the fashion world. fashionable : yves saint laurent 's paul deneve ( left ) and designer mark newson ( right ) also worked on it. ` if the watch is $ 10,000 , it would be a great way for apple to differentiate itself from the gadget-based market , which is highly competitive .. ` in my opinion , apple is very well positioned to make the transition to move up . '. if successful , the edition watch could act as a springboard for apple to rocket into its bulls-eye : china .. tim cook has repeatedly remarked that he predicts china to eventually overtake america as their biggest market .. the popularity of the iphone 6 drove the firm 's market share in china to a record high , reaching 25.4 per cent by january 2015 - clouding out samsung as the country 's second-largest seller .. however , xiaomi - widely dubbed ` the apple of china ' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market .. venturing into watches and potentially other wearables , with ahrendts at the helm , could be the leap that clinches it .. dawson said : ` they could really move into anything - necklaces , bracelets , brooches ... it 's not clear how those might feature a screen to function in the way that a watch does .. but apple is certainly in a position to try .

kris commons says he wants celtic 's arch-rivals rangers in the scottish premiership as soon as possible -- despite the ibrox club suffering a lamentable 2-2 home draw with alloa on tuesday night .. championship leaders hearts could clinch automatic promotion to the top tier if results go their way this weekend .. that would leave rangers embroiled in a grim battle for the second promotion spot under new manager stuart mccall , although on current form they could even miss the play-offs .. celtic forward kris commons , pictured training on tuesday , wants rangers back in the top flight. however , in a view unlikely to curry unanimous favour amongst celtic supporters , commons -- who scored in the recent league cup semi-final between the glasgow giants -- admits he wants the old firm fixture back next season .. ` personally , yes , because the games with rangers are the best games , ' said the parkhead forward .. ` they draw the best crowds and a large tv audience for people around the world .. it makes people want to get out of bed in the middle of the night in australia .. ` my mates down south do n't know much about scottish football but they want to see that game .. i love playing in them .. ` there are a lot of fans who are on the fence ( about ) whether it 's right or wrong but i love them .

north korea has fired two ballistic missiles more than 300 miles into the sea in what has been called an ` armed protest ' against military drills in the south .. a spokesman for the secretive state threatened ` merciless strikes ' against south korea and its ally the u.s. , which helps conduct the military drills every year and insists they are just defensive .. the war between the two koreas is still active because it ended in 1953 with an armistice , not a peace treaty , and left a heavily armed two-and-a-half mile wide zone along the border .. making a statement : south korean tv shows the two missile tests by the north today .. the secretive state warned there would be ` merciless strikes ' against routine military exercises carried out south of the border. training : south korean soldiers begin the annual military exercises near the demilitarized zone between the two koreas - which despite its name is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world. north korea regularly conducts test firings of missiles , rockets and artillery , but they are often timed to express the country 's dissatisfaction with actions by washington and seoul .. the missiles were fired early this morning at the start of military drills which are due to run until the end of april .. fired from the west coast , they flew around 300 miles across the width of north korea before landing in waters off the east coast , according to south korea 's defense ministry .. spokesman kim min-seok called the launches an ` armed protest ' against the south korea-u.s. drills and a challenge to peace on the korean peninsula .. un resolutions prohibit any ballistic missile test by north korea , and mr kim said pyongyang appeared intent on triggering a ` security crisis ' .. ` we will respond sternly and strongly to any provocation , ' he added .. a statement carried by north korea 's state-run news agency said : ` the situation on the korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war .. anger : protesters gathered today near the u.s. embassy in the south korean capital seoul. uncompromising : north korean leader kim jong un has taken an aggressive stance against the west. ` the only means to cope with the aggression and war by the u.s. imperialists and their followers is neither dialogue nor peace .. they should be dealt with only by merciless strikes . '. officials in the north korean capital pyongyang claim the drills are ` intolerable aggression ' and preparation for an invasion - but south korea says they are simply routine exercises .. the largest element of the two drills that began today is foal eagle , an eight-week exercise involving air , ground and naval field training , with around 200,000 korean and 3,700 us troops .. the other is a week-long , largely computer-simulated joint drill called key resolve .. around 28,500 american soldiers are deployed in south korea as deterrence against potential aggression from the north .. north korea has threatened attacks , including nuclear strikes , on the u.s. before , although it has never demonstrated its missiles could reach the u.s. mainland .. during the 2013 drills , tension rose amid north korean rhetoric that included vows of nuclear strikes on washington and seoul .. north korea has carried out three nuclear tests - in 2006 , 2009 and 2013 .. in january , the north offered a moratorium on further tests if this year 's joint drills were cancelled - a proposal rejected by washington as an ` implicit threat ' to carry out a fourth atomic detonation .. peace talks : there were hopes of the third summit between the koreas since 1953 , but the prospect is dim. threats : protesters outside the embassy .. people floating anti-pyongyang flyers by balloon could be targeted. jeung young-tae , an analyst at the korea institute for national unification in seoul , said pyongyang was unlikely to conduct a fourth test just to protest against the exercises .. ` nuclear tests carry more significance than that , ' he said .. ` on the other hand , there is the chance of a mid - or long-range missile test . '. i would say that a demonstration that it could deliver a nuclear warhead would be more threatening to the world than an actual nuclear test ' .. a new research report by u.s. experts published last week estimated that north korea could be on track to have an arsenal of 100 nuclear weapons by 2020 .. in a further sign of rising tensions , north korean state-run website uriminzokkiri warned today of a fierce response to any attempt by south korean activists to float anti-pyongyang leaflets across the border by balloon .. ` the response might not just be a few shots of gunfire but cannons or missiles , ' the website said .. the two koreas floated the possibility earlier this year of holding what would be the third summit between their leaders since the countries were divided 70 years ago .. it is not certain whether the meeting will take place because the two countries disagree on terms .

president barack obama 's most secretive and controversial adviser is n't going anywhere , despite six years of whisper campaigns and public derision offered up by republicans .. valerie jarrett , the onetime aide to then-chicago mayor richard daley , was introduced to obama by a young staffer then named michelle robinson .. in short order she had the future leader of the free world 's future plans mapped out and underway .. it does n't help her public image that she was born in iran , albeit to american parents .. or that she 's unelected and has never faced the senate confirmation process .. but american presidents have broad discretion to appoint their own advisers , and jarrett now says she 'll ` stay until the lights go off . '. power : during a july 2014 broadcast interview with nbc , jarrett showed off her office -- including a picture frame decorated with figurines bowing to her. obama-whisperer : jarrett is the president 's closest adviser but has never faced an election or a senate confirmation vote. the new york times magazine interviewed jarrett for a feature published on friday , hearing her say that her relationship to obama is nothing like the famously cozy one between former president george w. bush and vice presdient dick cheney .. ` please do n't say that .. stop right there , ' she insisted .. ` the president listens to people who have interesting things to say -- that could be the most junior person on the staff or it could be a senior adviser or it could be a person who whispers something to him across a rope line . '. there 's nothing new about close advisers in the white house , not even with the spacious west wing office jarrett has occupied since 2009 .. george w. bush had karen hughes .. bill clinton had bruce lindsey .. ronald reagan had michael deaver .. thomas jefferson had james madison .. ` night-stalker ' : jarrett has access to both the west wing and the upstairs presidential residence , drawing resentment from other senior staff. but a republican congressional staffer who requested anonymity spoke frankly about jarrett on friday , telling daily mail online that she ` is clearly obama 's rasputin , subtlely steering the ship of state . '. ` valerie jarrett has the kind of influence on the federal government that the constitution was designed to prevent , ' the staffer said .. the new republic once reported on quiet discussions with an unnamed former obama administration official who explained aides ' resentment of her all-hours access status with the first family -- a situation that has earned her the nickname ` the night stalker . '. ` it 's pretty toxic , ' the official said .. ` she went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to -- basically all of them -- and then would go and whisper to the president .. or at least everyone believed she did .. ... people do n't trust the process .. they think she 's a spy . '. jarrett told the times that having obama 's ear and knowing his instincts ` initially it probably made people a little uncomfortable , ' but ' i think that has faded .. i just want to do my job , and part of my job for the president is to be his friend . '. ` whatever meeting she wanted ' : jarrett reportedly has carte blanche to sit in with obama wherever and whenever she chooses -- including this february 2014 sit-down with business leaders where she sat closer to the president than former secretary of state colin powell. ` rastputin ' : a republican congressional aide likened jarrett to grigori rasputin , the mystical russian faith healer who earned the nickname ` mad monk ' as he wielded influence over tsar nicholas ii and his wife. what has n't faded is the washington-wide perception that she has outsize influence .. recent books and white house interviews have fed that fire more oxygen .. in his book ` leading from behind , ' noted terrorism expert and multiple new york times best-selling author richard miniter reported that the president called off -- three times -- a planned the navy seal raid that killed al-qaeda mastermind osama bin laden .. it was jarrett who persuaded him to step back each time , according to miniter 's sources .. the white house later denied his account .. and ed klein , whose book ` blood feud ' traced the arc of a decade-long rivalry between the obamas and the clintons , said wednesday on the fox news channel that the white house -- not scheming republicans -- is behind the swirling scandal over hillary clinton 's secret email server .. klein cited sources who told him jarrett and obama are jointly behind it since neither wants sto see mrs. clinton measuring the oval office 's drapes .. white house staffers , he told fox news , are seeing ` tons of documents being wheeled through the corridors from clinton 's old offices , and they 're going through these looking for problems on her expense account , on her dealings with foreign leaders . '. ` all of this , i 'm told , is prompted by valerie jarrett and the president , who do not want to see hillary clinton president of the united states , ' klein said .. jarrett explanied away the bow-to-me photo frame on twitter. in a profile published during obama 's first year in office , the president told the independent that ` valerie is one of my oldest friends .. over time , i think our relationship evolved to the point where she 's like a sibling to me ... i trust her completely . '. he trusts jarrett , he said , ` to speak for me , particularly when we 're dealing with delicate issues . '. obama also trusts her , it seems , to give tv interviews like the one she granted nbc news last july .. her message , though , was overshadowed by a camera shot of a framed photo of herself of a bookshelf -- complete with three figurines posed bowing in homage to her image .. jarrett later fell back on a tweet claiming it was ' a gag gift .

growing numbers of pets are being fed antidepressants to reduce their stress while left home alone all day , vets have warned .. an estimated 80 per cent of britain 's pet dogs suffer from behavioural conditions , with many linked to being cooped up in an empty house for hours at a time .. long periods of separation from their owners can lead to hyperactivity , obsessive-compulsive behaviour and anxiety , vets say .. growing numbers of pets are being fed antidepressants to reduce their stress while left home alone all day , vets have warned. but with people living busier lives than ever before , many pet owners are turning to drugs to quell the problems .. experts are worried people are feeding dogs and cats their own supplies of human antidepressants , or getting a prescription from their vet for animal-specific medication .. andrew knight , professor of animal welfare and ethics at the university of winchester , told the sunday telegraph : ` the number of behavioural problems in dogs and cats , and even other pets , such as birds , seen by veterinarians is huge .. ` we 're constantly seeing animals that are aggressive , unduly fearful , or barely under control when they visit , although my colleagues and i do our best to put them at ease with gentle handling and tasty treats .. ` instead of attempting to calm or even sedate our stressed pets with pharmaceuticals , it 's about time we started giving our pets the care and attention they really deserve .. only then might we truly be eligible to call ourselves a nation of animal lovers . '. an estimated 80 per cent of britain 's pet dogs suffer from behavioural conditions , with many linked to being cooped up in an empty house for hours at a time. there are several licenced antidepressants for animals on the market , including clomipramine , selegiline , reconcile , which each work in a similar way to fluoxetine - the human antidepressant which goes under the trade name prozac .. a recent report by the people 's dispensary for sick animals ( pdsa ) found that more than a quarter of dog owners leave their pet alone in the house for five hours or more during a weekday and that 250,000 dogs are never walked -- leading to serious behavioural problems .. dr knight said dogs need love and attention .. ` dogs need to be walked , every day , yet too many are left at home with little to do while owners go to work , ' he said .. ` it 's hardly surprising many resort to barking and demolishing the furniture , in their desperation for attention and stimulation .. such problems are widespread within our pet population , and constitute a major , under-recognised animal welfare problem . '. the british small animal veterinary association said that medication should only be used after diagnosis by a vet .

'. the hand works by opening and closing when abbi bends her wrist up or down .. it has a velcro which straps around her palm and the gauntlet sits on her arm .. abbi had an operation at 18 months old , taking parts of her toes to give her a bigger palm , and replacing the toes with hip bone .. but her mother said she and husband jim , 34 , would not consider any more operations after seeing the success of her hand .. she said : ` it is fantastic and we just ca n't stop her using it .. she wants to wear it all the time and can not believe what she has now got .. new lease : julie jillians says the pink hand has changed abbi 's life and the four-year-old has been testing out the new kit by picking things up and putting them down all over the house. abbi 's hand costs around # 50 in materials to print a hand , so new limbs can be created as she grows. ` she is still building up her strength and getting used to it - and she can not hold anything too heavy .. ` but she is going around picking everything up , from cups to fruit , and playing with all the toys she was never able to before ..

former australian netball captain liz ellis has championed a controversial netball ad after critics claim it draws uncomfortable parallels to a domestic violence ad .. the fox sports ad , which is promoting the upcoming anz netball championships , depicts diamonds star sharni layton with a badly blackened eye .. an injury ms ellis claims she earned ` giving her all ' in training earlier that week .. ` i love the ad , ' ms ellis told daily mail australia .. standing tall : sharni layton did n't want to use make up to cover the black eye she sustained in a training session. liz ellis penned a though provoking article hitting back at critics of the ad saying it shows what netballers are capable of. ` it 's great because it shows what netballers are capable of and it does n't shy away from the fact that they are physical , ' she added .. ms ellis penned a column for the age defending the controversial ad after critics claimed ms layton 's bruised and bloodshot left eye was distasteful .. she hit back saying more people need to recognise that these highly trained athletes are not only capable of putting their body on the line , but they love it .. ` i think people do n't want to emphasise the fact that it is a physical game and women can go hard . '. australian tv journalist sam squires claims the ad could have conveyed the message that womens sport is tough without such a ` confronting image . '. sam squires likened the sports injury to one sustained at the hands of an abuser. liz ellis is adamant that women play with a level of physicality that can sometimes lead to injuries. ` it screams violence not toughness , ' she said in an article on her website .. respectfully disagreeing , ms ellis said it would be a mistake to see elite female athletes , playing with the ferocity that men would , and assume it 's an act of violence .. ` the game is n't violent , the players do n't go out there to inflict pain , there is no malice .. netball is a tough game and that 's what it portrays . ' '. i do n't think this conversation would have happened if it were a blokes sport , ' she added .. twitter users expressed their support by backing ms ellis ' claims that women and girls can be tough on court .. star player sharni layton sustained the controversial eye injury in a training session and was offered to cover it up with make up before shooting the ad .. she declined as she saw no reason to cover up the realities of the game .. ms ellis says people do n't want to emphasise the level of physicality involved in netball. ms ellis said she was elated to see a role model for young girls who can say ` look at what i can do , not at how i look ' .. ` this is so vital because of the way society is .. little girls from a young age are reinforced that it 's all about how you look , ' she told daily mail australia .. ` what sport does is that it flips it from what your body looks like to what your body can actually do .. how high can you jump ?. how fast can you run ?. how far can you throw ? '. ms ellis wants young girls to focus less on what they look like on court and more on what their body can actually do. the ad highlights the athletes physical prowess but has been heavily criticised. while ms ellis is adamant this particular ad does n't trivialise domestic violence , she said can see why people would assume ` that when a woman is bruised she is a victim . '. ms ellis said the notion of domestic violence is becoming ` all pervasive ' due to the unfortunate fact that it is far more likely for a woman to suffer injuries at the hand of a partner than on a netball court .. ` we ca n't ask people to change that perception until women are n't victims .. and that 's where we have to start , ' she added .. the #likeagirl campaign , which the ad is loosely based off , took off in june last year after releasing a video which challenges the perception of what the phrase " like a girl " means .

officials in indiana knew that a 16-year-old mentally disabled girl was being subjected to appalling neglect four years before she was rushed to hospital covered in feces and weighing just 35lb .. the girl was in such a grave condition that she was put on life support at peyton manning children 's hospital in indianapolis last december .. the victim is the granddaughter of steve sells , 58 , who , along with his wife , joetta , 54 , and their daughter , crystal , 21 , has been charged with neglect .. ` cruel ' : steve and joetta sells were granted custody in 2009 when their daughter , crystal , abandoned her child. scene : sells allegedly locked his granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom without enough heat .. when detectives searched the house , they found a mattress , a bucket and a bowl of oatmeal in the bedroom. court documents indicate that the teenager was brutally beaten by her caretakers , lodged on a blood-and-feces-stained mattress and forced to eat human waste and go to the bathroom in a bucket .. now it transpires that the indiana department of child services ( dcs ) first learnt of her ordeal as far back as 2010 , with the teenager 's harrowing plight brought to the attention of authorities multiple times since , according to the indystar.com .. it claims that according to dcs records dated september 21 , 2010 , someone told the body that the victim , then 11 , was ` very malnourished ' , had a bruise on her check and had not been seen in school .. the dcs told the family it was going to investigate the claims , citing ` serious medical concerns ' .. records show that steve sells was ` extremely hostile ' in meeting about the allegations , but agreed with his wife to co-operate , taking his granddaughter to a doctor and dietician several times .. in november the dcs moved to dismiss the case , indystar.com reports , due to lack of evidence .. third suspect : crystal sells , 21 , has been charged with seven counts of battery , confinement and neglect targeting her mentally-disabled 16-year-old niece living with crystal 's parents. but a report landed on their doormat again the following october claiming that the pair were keeping the girl prisoner in her room for days at a time without food and denying her access to a toilet .. the family claimed that the girl was being kept locked up for her own safety .. in november 2011 the dcs closed its investigation , saying that it did n't have enough evidence to prosecute the family .. last december the girl was taken to st. vincent hospital in anderson covered in feces and so thin that police said bone were protruding from her skin .. she was then flown to peyton manning children 's hospital in indianapolis in critical condition .. in january crystal sells was arrested on seven counts of battery , confinement and aiding/inducing or causing the neglect of a dependent causing serious bodily injury .. investigators say sells played a major role in the abuse targeting her special-needs niece .. the arrest came a month after steve sells and his wife joetta were charged with neglect .. according to probable cause affidavits , crystal sells was seen on one occasion striking her mentally disabled relative in the head with a plastic chair , wish-tv reported .. when questioned by police , miss sells admitted to the abuse and said that even after she had realized that what was being done to the girl was wrong , she did nothing to stop it .. ` there were clearly times over the course of the four years where she was involved in the batteries , she was involved in the criminal confinement and she clearly could have gotten help for this young girl if she chose to and did not , ' said madison county prosecutor rodney cummings .. court documents show that joetta and crystal sells waited three hours to call an ambulance after the girl was found unresponsive december 1 , giving them enough time to come up with a plausible story in order to avoid prison time , according to a relative .. that same relative said the women seemed more distraught by the prospect of going to jail than the girl 's appalling condition .. steve sells , the girl 's legal guardian since 2009 , was initially charged with 12 counts of neglect and battery .. he was hit with additional charges of theft , perjury and welfare fraud for allegedly misusing his granddaughter 's social security benefits totaling $ 55,000 , according to wthr .. jannifer sells and her fiance said they want the girl to come live with them once she feels better. his wife faces 11 felonies counts of neglect of a dependent , criminal confinement and battery resulting in bodily injury .. the couple are being held on $ 100,000 bonds .. mr sells was awarded custody of the girl after claiming that his daughter , jannifer sells , had abandoned her. speaking to fox 59 in january , miss sells said she was shocked to discover that her father allegedly had been abusing his own granddaughter .. in december doctors at peyton manning children 's hospital recommended taking the teenager off life support , so grave was her condition , but around new year 's eve she rallied .. she is now said to be awake and capable of getting out of bed .. jannifer sells and her husband-to-be anthony gaw said they want the girl to come live with them once she regains her health .. the sells family allegedly kept the teenager locked in a room with only a mattress , space heater , blankets , a bowl with oatmeal and a bucket , according to the documents first shared by fox59 in december .. authorities noted that the door had a lock at the top , out of reach of the teenager , and another child at the home said sells would lock the door ` during the day and nights ' .. the child told authorities that they would sometimes see the girl 's fingers reaching around the door , in an apparent attempt to get out , the documents said .. everything inside the room was covered with feces and blood , authorities said .. the gruesome conditions were unearthed after concerned relatives took the girl to hospital december 1 and doctors contacted authorities .. they then executed a search warrant at the home .. ` if you see pictures of the victim , it 's very disturbing , ' sgt. joel sandefur said told the indy channel .. ` we would n't accept treatment of an animal that way , let alone a human being , a 15-year-old girl . '. the teenager and a four-year-old child moved in with the couple when their mother abandoned them four years ago , according to the court documents .. the older girl , whose grandfather said suffers from a chromosome problem in her brain , was kept locked up inside the room by steve sells , according to his wife of six years .. she had not been to the doctors or to school in two years , the indy channel reported .. he told authorities he locked her in the room to protect himself , claiming that the 35lb girl was strong and had previously approached him with a knife .. neighbor thomas mcallister told said that sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children .. he said that sells had always given the impression he was a caring father .. ` that is mind boggling , ' he added .. ` that is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that .

( cnn ) about 15 years ago , i was doing research on inheritance laws in malawi and their impact on women .. part of my research methodology was to engage in focus group discussions with women in village settings .. in order to do this in any village in malawi , one has to seek permission from the village chief .. the chief told me to come back the next day so that he can have time to mobilize the women , as well as give them proper notice of the proposed discussion .. when i came back the next day , the " women " had indeed gathered waiting for me .. however i noticed that the " women " were not women , as such .. i said to the chief " i was hoping to talk to women and not to kids or girls , as i do n't think they would understand much about inheritance . ". his response was , " but these are our women ; look , they have babies with them and they are all married . ". then it dawned on me , " aah , girl-child marriages . ". after asking , i found the girls ' ages ranged from 13 to 18 , with two being 24 .. this then spurred me into action and it was the beginning of a decade-plus journey of understanding girl-child marriages in my country and fighting for the practice to end .. what i found out was disheartening as the statistics came in .. i was horrified to learn that malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world .. it is ranked eighth of the 20 countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the u.n. population fund .. on average , one out of two girls in malawi will be married by their 18th birthday , according to the united nations .. in 2010 , half of the women ( 50 % ) aged 20 -- 24 years were married or in a union before age 18 ( compared to 6.4 % of boys ) , while 12 % of women married before they were 15 compared to only 1.2 % of men .. child marriage is in both rural and urban areas .. it is also higher than the regional average for sub-saharan africa ( 37 % ) .. ` law , save the girls ! '. being a lawyer , i looked to the law .. " my hero the law , save the girls , " i thought !. yet , i soon found out that this was a complex story .. the constitution of malawi , which is the supreme law of the land from whom all legal authority is derived , has provided for some measures of protection for all children .. however the same constitution defines children as those aged 16 and below .. the united nations defines children as those aged 18 and below and so to that extent the constitution does not comply with international standards on definitions of childhood .. the constitution also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut-off point where marriage is actually prohibited .. this means for all intents and purposes , the constitution of the republic of malawi allows child marriages .. alas the law had failed me !. but there was hope in the air .. in february , malawi 's parliament passed the marriage , divorce & family relations bill of 2015 into law .. this law was born amid the outcry against girl-child marriage , as the country had realized the dangers of girl-child marriage .. save for a few areas , it is a very progressive piece of legislation , particularly from a women 's rights perspective .. among other things , the law prohibits marriage for anybody below the age of 18 .. so , does it mean that the constitutional provisions fall away ?. the spanner in the works is that since the constitution allows marriage below the age of 18 , the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid .. so whilst many have celebrated the new law , i have n't , as girls remain shackled by a constitutional provision that basically allows child marriage .. so until the constitution changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above , and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated , i will remain sad as i was 15 years ago .. i will remain sad because i know the cost of child marriage .. it deprives girls of education and undermines their self-confidence and self-identity .. it also makes them prone to physical and emotional abuse by their so called husbands .. further to this , girl-child marriage inevitably means early parentage and higher risks of maternal mortality .. as if this is not enough , studies have shown that girl-child marriage is a risk factor in the transmission of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections , as young wives do not have much bargaining power to negotiate safe sex with older men .. girl-child marriages need to be prohibited tough the constitution because they are a violation of every conceivable human right including the right to life , health , education , human dignity and development .. what i know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and i want it to end .. the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of seodi white .

'. this week the sound that has filled our concert halls and all the spaces where music-lovers gather has been of loud cheering .. when it was announced on tuesday that sir simon rattle will be coming home from germany in 2017 to run the london symphony orchestra , whoops of delight could be heard all the way from london 's barbican centre , where the lso play , to menlove avenue , woolton , the middle-class suburb of liverpool where rattle was born 60 years ago .. the most remarkable english classical musician since the celebrated beecham , rattle has scaled the highest peaks .. appointed cbe at the ripe old age of 32 , he was knighted seven years later , and elected principal conductor of the berlin philharmonic , the world 's most formidable orchestra , at 44 .. conductor sir simon rattle is to join london symphony orchestra as music director. in an age of overpaid footballers and gruesome shows like the x factor , an age when the mediocre wear garlands tossed by dullards , here is a man who has truly earned his laurel crown .. when he received the weighty badge of the order of merit last summer ( ` do n't try conducting with this thing on ! '. the queen told him at the investiture ) it was formal recognition that he belonged to the best of the best .. now the man who conquered the world is coming home to join our leading orchestra and , what 's more , he sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador , an educator , whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can .. ` frankly , ' he says , ` what goes on in the primary school is going to be just as important as what goes on in any concert hall . '. knowing rattle as i do , this was no throw-away remark .. talk of greatness is usually misplaced .. there are never many truly great performers in any field .. so when they do come along it is our duty to recognise the special gifts that lift them above the pack .. we could call it the federer distinction .. roger federer is a great tennis player , perhaps the greatest ; andy murray is merely very good .. in the performing arts it can be difficult to describe what greatness looks like because , unlike in sport , there are no clear winners and losers .. over time , however , you have a sense of those who achieve it .. laurence olivier , for instance , was a great actor .. rudolf nureyev was a great dancer .. frank sinatra was a great singer .. and sir simon rattle is unquestionably a great musician .. born on the same road in liverpool as john lennon , rattle was at primary school when the beatles took off like a rocket .. no magical mystery tours for him , though .. the rattler , as he is known , was a bookish child , who played the piano and was later a percussionist in the national youth orchestra .. ` i tried to interest him in cricket and football ' , said his father denis , ` but he always seemed to have his head in a music score . '. sir simon ( right ) , whose youngest child with czech mezzo-soprano magdalena kožená ( left ) , 41 , is seven months old , has directed the berlin philharmonic since 2002. denis rattle , originally from kent , was a businessman who taught english in his retirement .. at oxford university , where he knew sir edward heath , he had played in a jazz band , so he did nothing to discourage his son 's enthusiasm for music .. when denis and pauline rattle took their son to see the comedian al read at the liverpool empire , the five-year-old stopped the show .. so many members of the audience were amused by the sight of a curious little boy leaving his seat to peer into the orchestra pit that read had to tell him : ` come on , lad .. i 've got a show to do ! '. the young rattle never set foot in liverpool 's football ground anfield or everton 's goodison park as his father might have wished but he was a regular at the city 's wonderful philharmonic hall where , in 1966 , his life changed for ever .. gustav mahler 's mighty second symphony , the resurrection , despite its challenging discords , made him realise even then , aged 11 , that he wanted to be a conductor .. and now he was determined to learn how .. he studied music scores his sister brought home from the library ; he pored over composers ' writings on orchestration .. he would write down the percussion parts of big orchestral pieces , gather friends and family , and hand out those parts so he could conduct his impromptu orchestra while a record of the music played in the background .. when he was 15 , he cajoled enough musicians together to form a proper orchestra and stage a charity event at liverpool 's college hall .. it was a resounding success .. rattle 's days as conductor of the city of birmingham symphony orchestra are the stuff of legend .. when he went there aged 25 in 1980 he was , musically speaking , barely out of short pants and the orchestra was at best lacklustre .. when he left 18 years later as a knight of the realm , the cbso was acclaimed as one of the world 's finest orchestras , and had a magnificent new home .. symphony hall , which opened in june 1991 as a result of rattle 's persistence and enlightened cross-party political co-operation , remains the best concert hall in britain .. so when people talk about the cultural development of birmingham , and rattle 's substantial part in it , they are not fibbing .. the question is : what can he do for london and britain ?. there is a clear will to build a concert hall worthy of london 's unrivalled reputation as a city of culture and rattle knows , for he is no fool , that his appointment can only assist the process .. in the city they are no fools either .. everybody understands that , with rattle at the helm of such a fine orchestra , the lso could become world-beaters not only in public performances but also in the world of music education .. rattle sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador , an educator , whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can. rattle once described how moving it was to bring deaf children into rehearsals in birmingham , and see how they responded through vibration alone to the experience of a beethoven symphony .. in berlin he wasted no time in working with children from the city 's less well-off backgrounds , involving them in dance collaborations with the berlin philharmonic .. some musicians , brought up in the old school , were sceptical but not for long .. ` what simon wants ' , musicians used to say , ` simon gets ' .. which is why his return to london is so thrilling , and so important .. in a world of show-offs and halfwits , here is a man with the faith and willpower to move mountains : not on his own behalf but for an art form itself .. he believes that great music can transform lives .. describing leonard bernstein , the great american conductor and educator , who wrote west side story in his spare time , a musician once said : ` lenny reminds you why you wanted to become a musician in the first place . '. that is rattle 's talent too but how he achieves it is hard to pin down .. it is the conductor who makes all the difference as to whether a performance sinks or swims .. what you see as he steps on to the podium , is the tip of a vast iceberg of activity involving planning , preparing , rehearsing , managing schedules and endless background work to understand the music .. this is what helps make simon rattle one of the world 's greatest , says his biographer sir nicholas kenyon : ` he is a meticulous planner , has a fantastic insight for the right combination of pieces in a concert programme and is a brilliant pacer and galvaniser of rehearsals , knowing exactly what he has to achieve and motivating his players accordingly . '. but it still fails to explain his achievements .. when his performances take off , musicians and audiences alike would rather be nowhere else .. it is n't so much a matter of his technique with the conductor 's baton , or bringing in the trombones when they 're feeling left out as something undefinable .. in 1999 , a critic memorably described him on the podium : ` sometimes he bent to his knees , puffed his cheeks and mimed a straw-chewing yokel to encourage a proportionate rustic attitude in his players .. that was especially during beethoven 's " pastoral " symphony ... during the pizzicato interlude in mahler 's second symphony , he dropped his hands to his sides and encouraged his band just to pluck 'n' swing . '. what audiences see in rattle is a man who feels that , for as long as he is conducting it , that piece is the most important thing in the world .. musicians , hardly sentimental , are happy to follow him because every concert is an adventure .. as rattle says : ` always the journey , never the destination ' .. his genius , as it always will be with the greats , is that he possesses an alignment of mind and heart that can not be taught .. ` simon can achieve things in a performance , ' a berlin musician said last week , ` that can never be learnt . '. now he is coming home for what he calls ` one last challenge ' .. to which we can only cry : ` hurrah ! '

sky is to increase its prices for sports and family entertainment packages in britain , just six weeks after it agreed to pay a record fee for the rights to show premier league football matches .. sky , which normally increases its prices in september , said on thursday the price of a sports tv package would rise by # 1 to # 47 a month .. it reflects the balancing act it is attempting after agreeing to pay # 4.2 billion to show 126 live premier league matches a season from 2016 to 2019 , fending off fierce rival bt .. sky said upon the announcement of the record premier league deal that it would try to make sure its customers would not have to foot the bill .. as of june , it will cost # 47 a month to watch sky sports pundits such as thierry henry ( centre ). sky will no longer have rights to broadcast champions league games from next season. sky paid # 4.2 billion to broadcast 126 live games a season from 2016 to 2019 in the premier league. ` the company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on customers , with the majority of the funding coming through substantial additional savings to be delivered by efficiency plans , ' a sky spokesman said upon the announcement of the rights in february .. sky 's family bundle , which includes its highest profile shows and box-sets of drama , would rise by # 3 a month to # 36 .. analysts said the lower price rise for sports channels might reflect a concern within the company that viewers could defect to bt , which won the right to show 42 games a season and has also beaten sky to show champions league matches from later this year .. the price increases will take effect in june .. analysts at citi said this was prudent as the previous timetable would have resulted in sky trying to increase prices just as the champions league matches disappeared from its channels .. sky suggested its customers would not have to foot the bill for the record premier league tv deal. graphic charts the significant rise of domestic premier league tv revenue. seven packages were available in the auction , five with 28 games per season and two with 14 games per season .. package a comprises 28 games on saturday lunchtimes ( 12.30 pm ) .. package c has 28 games kicking off between 1.30 pm and 2.15 pm on sundays .. pack a has 6 ` first pick ' games from 38 rounds and b has 9 first picks .. package d is the 4pm sunday bundle of 28 games - crucially with 18 ` first pick ' games .. package e is the ` monday night football ' ( 8pm ) bundle , with 18 games on mondays plus 10 on fridays ; this is the first time premier league games will be shown live on friday evenings .. there are no first picks in this package .. package g is a bundle of 14 games on bank holidays and other sunday matches with two first picks .. package b has 28 games at tea-time on saturdays ( 5.30 pm ). packages f has 14 games , a mix of midweek and saturday games including three first picks .. under the current ongoing deals sky have paid # 2.28 bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season , or in other words , get 348 games at # 6,551,724 each .. bt have paid # 738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season , or in other words , get 114 games at # 6,473,684 each .. 50 per cent of the revenue is divided equally between the clubs. 25 per cent is awarded on a merit basis , determined by final league positions. 25 per cent is distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches. sky may also have been encouraged to move ahead with price rises now after recent quarterly results showed the number of people leaving the platform had reduced .. ` the experience of canal + in france suggests losing rights does not impact subscriber volumes , but does impair pricing power , ' citi said .. the analysts said the price rises could result in an around 10 percent increase to earnings per share .. shares in sky , which has recently expanded into germany , italy and austria , were up 1.4 percent , outperforming the ftse 100 index which was up 0.4 percent .
a suspected banksy of a pouting young girl is believed to now be worthless after a vandal painted over it so she is now wearing a burkha .. the artwork , which first appeared on the side of the north star pub in hounslow , west london , in 2007 , was defaced over the weekend .. the 6ft tall mural , thought to be worth # 100,000 , has the word ` smile ' in brightly coloured letters written above the girl , originally pictured in pigtails - but now only her eyes remain visible .. the banksy of a pouting young girl in hounslow , which first appeared in 2007 ( left ) was defaced over the weekend to show the girl wearing a burkha , leaving only her eyes visible. local residents were left furious after the work - believed to be worth more than # 100,000 - was vandalised , adding it had been the ` only thing that made them smile in hounslow ' .. sandra d'souza said she was ` horrified ' when she saw the defaced artwork .. she said : ` i 'm sure it brought a smile to the face of lots of other people passing by and it 's such a shame it 's been defaced like this . '. sam spencer , 32 , added : ' i was walking to hounslow station on sunday , which is right near the banksy and saw the girl had been covered with a burkha . '. i do n't know what is wrong with people around here - it 's about the only thing hounslow has got going for it and now it 's ruined . '. twitter user @missfab2014 said the work was the ` only decent thing ' in hounslow and urged the artist to fix it. a twitter user , known as ems , urged the artist to come and fix the work .. she said : ` the only decent thing in hounslow and now look at it #banksy @thereaibanksy come sort it out pls !! '. soon after the mural appeared in 2007 , paul riley , the then landlord of the north star pub - now a bar called platform 3 - installed cctv to stop the banksy being vandalised .. it is not known if the cameras are still in place .. he said at the time : ' i phoned the council to tell them not to paint over it because it was a work of art .. ` they came to look at it and agreed with me .. i think it is lovely . '. update : a representative for banksy has confirmed to mailonline that the work is not by the artist .. the work has now been restored .. because of the value attached to many of banky 's pieces , his work had long been targeted by thieves hoping to sell stolen work for huge amounts .. but they 've also been attacked by vandals - some rival graffiti artists - for no other apparent purpose than to deface and destroy the work .. his spybooth painting , featuring three 1950s-style agents , wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats , using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box , appeared in cheltenham , gloucestershire , in april last year .. it soared in value when banksy confirmed it was one of his pieces - and the wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated # 1million to secure it for the town .. it was defaced a few months later - and last month , the stencil was granted grade ii-listed status .. the ` spybooth ' banksy in cheltenham features three agents , wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats , using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box .. pictured left , in 2014 and right , its defaced state. but the owner of the property it is on says the work has ` ruined his life ' .. david possee , 45 , says he has been unable to remove and sell the work - and can not carry out building work to make the house habitable .. last year , a banksy painting of a woman staring at an empty plinth on the wall of an amusement arcade in folkestone , kent , was valued at # 300,000 .. the local council quickly placed a perspex cover over the mural to protect it , heading off a potential disastrous act of vandalism when someone later crudely scrawled a penis on the plinth .. last october , a large mural in the elusive artist 's hometown of bristol - dubbed ` the girl with the pierced eardrum ' - had paint thrown over it days after it appeared .. the work , a parody of the famous girl with a pearl earring by dutch master vermeer , had a yellow alarm box replacing the earring from the original painting .
seventeen years after oregon decided to become the first state to hold all elections with mail-in ballots , it took another pioneering step on monday to broaden participation by automatically registering people to vote .. gov. kate brown signed a bill that puts the burden of registration on the state instead of voters .. under the legislation , every adult citizen in oregon who has interacted with the driver and motor vehicle services division since 2013 but has n't registered to vote will receive a ballot in the mail at least 20 days before the next statewide election .. the measure is expected to add about 300,000 new voters to the rolls .. eligible oregonians will get postcards saying they 've been registered and have three weeks to opt out .. they 'll automatically be registered as ` unaffiliated ' but can select a political party on the postcard and return it to election officials through the mail .. they can also choose to cancel their voter registration entirely .. oregon gov. kate brown signed an automatic voter registration bill on monday , march 16 ; oregon has been holding elections by mail for 17 years. oregon republicans are already angry about the possibility for voter fraud -- millions of ballots will be in mailboxes with limited control over what happens to them -- along with the cost of implementing the measure and whether the dmv can ensure personal information remains secure .. information the dmv has on file , such as age , residential information , signature and citizenship status , will be transferred to the secretary of state , who will then automatically update registration information .. but more than anything , oregon 's new law changes an ` opt-in ' voting system to one where people can only choose to ` opt out . '. ` it just changes expectations for who 's responsible for making elections work , ' said barry burden , a professor of political science at the university of wisconsin in madison and director of the elections research center .. ` in every other state it 's the responsibility for the voters to make sure it happens . '. some other states have considered such legislation but none has gone as far as oregon .. minnesota nearly implemented automatic voter registration in 2009 before the plan was vetoed by gov. tim pawlenty , who said ` registering to vote should be a voluntary , intentional act . '. similar concerns were raised by oregon 's minority republicans .. ` simply because it makes us unique or makes us first does not necessarily mean that it actually improves on what we 're doing , ' said state sen. jackie winters , a republican from salem .. when it came up for a vote in the state senate last week , all republicans and one democrat voted against it .. the democrats hold a 18-12 advantage in the senate so the bill easily passed .. state sen. elizabeth steiner hayward , a portland democrat who carried the bill in the senate , said there were rumblings the measure was a ` secret plot ' to enroll more democrats .. but she denied that was true .. oregon already has one of the highest voter registration rates in the nation -- 73 percent of oregonians were registered to vote and 70 percent of them cast ballots during the 2014 general election .. tony green , spokesman for the secretary of state , said the legislation is expected to eventually capture all unregistered voters who are in the dmv database after taking actions such as obtaining or renewing a driver 's license .. two years ago , when the measure was first proposed , green said there were questions about whether the driver and motor vehicle services division records were confidential under federal law .. the legislative counsel determined the secretary of state and the division could share information as long as it was for legitimate government purposes , he said .. accidental governor : brown 's predecessor , john kitzhaber , resigned after his fiancee was accused of using her influence with the governor to benefit clients of her eco-consulting company. oregon 's move will result in about 300,000 ballots being sent through the mail to people who will be automatically registered to vote. automatic registration is not uncommon in other countries .. a 2009 report by the brennan center for justice says nations where the government takes the lead in enrolling voters have much higher registration rates .. argentina has a 100 percent registration rate , while sweden , australia and canada all have registration rates over 90 percent .. myrna perez , deputy director of the brennan center 's democracy program , said a state needs to already have reliable agency records of eligible americans who have demonstrated citizenship in order to successfully follow in oregon 's footsteps .. oregon only grants driver 's licenses to people who can prove they 're in the u.s. legally by presenting passports , birth certificates or other documents .. david house , a spokesman for the driver and motor vehicle services division , has said the agency can separate citizens from noncitizens based on those documents .. oregonians were the first to see all-mail elections , and the state has since been followed by washington state and colorado .. ` oregon is a true leader in accessibility to voting and i challenge every other state in this nation to examine their policies and find ways to ensure there are as few barriers as possible in the way of the citizen 's right to vote , ' brown said .. brown took office last month after her predecesor john kitzhaber resigned over ethics allegations involving his fiancee-adviser and a string of government contracts .
adorning a large section of a wall in the gym beneath twickenham 's west stand is a picture of the england team smiling for the cameras and showing off the triple crown .. it was taken last year and the expressions worn by captain chris robshaw and his colleagues convey a genuine sense of pride .. that silver shield has eluded the national team this year , following defeat in dublin , but it is not the precious metal they covet anyway .. on head coach stuart lancaster 's watch , the trophy cabinet has been kept stocked .. in the course of three years , in addition to the triple crown , england have lifted the calcutta cup ( annually ) , the millennium trophy , the cook cup and the hillary shield .. the latter prize , for beating new zealand in december , 2012 , was received with special relish .. luther burrell sets off on a run during training as england prepare to face france. but what the coaches and players really crave is a cup that conveys meaningful achievement , and at last that is within their grasp .. robshaw summed up the mood : ` as a player you want to be picking up silverware .. we 've collected the odd bit here and there , but to pick up the main trophy would be great . '. the ` main trophy ' , newly commissioned , for winning the rbs 6 nations is england 's for the taking .. success would also end a generation of under-achievement .. it is staggering that the world 's wealthiest rugby country has had so little to show for so much effort and investment in the modern era .. england won three of the first four rbs 6 nations titles ( 2000 , 2001 , 2003 ) but since then have finished top just once in 11 seasons .. so near , but so far has been the story of many english campaigns , not least under the current regime .. three times lancaster 's men have finished runners-up , with four wins out of five .. wales ( twice ) , and france have derailed the sweet chariot on its route to a grand slam .. everyone in the red rose camp has grown weary of the perennial talk about the need for ` tangible ' reward , to use lock geoff parling 's apt phrase .. defeat by ireland shattered the latest quest for a clean sweep to propel the host nation into their world cup , but england are still in prime position in terms of the three-way title tussle .. this year , four wins from five should be sufficient to clinch the trophy , which will be at twickenham in anticipation of a coronation at about 7pm .. there is a replica at murrayfield , just in case ireland run amok and beat scotland with room to spare and leave england chasing a points-difference tally that proves beyond them .. meanwhile , in rome , wales will expect to benefit from the enforced absence of italy captain sergio parisse but they would require french and scottish resistance on an epic scale to take the title .. the made-for-tv staggered schedule affords lancaster 's side the luxury of a precise target but that could be a blessing or a curse .. being aware of the bigger picture could be a distraction for some england players , hence the coaches ' desire to burden only a select few with the main decision-making responsibilities .. it will be up to robshaw and his half-backs , ben youngs and george ford , to set a patient tone once what is needed has been explained to the whole squad before their pre-match warm-up .. the remarkable maturity of england no 10 ford , at just 22 , should be a telling asset on a day when the challenge is equal parts mental and physical .. england 's players look on in disbelief as ireland clinch the 2014 six nations title by beating france. george ford has shown a huge amount of maturity for some one who is just 22. philippe saint-andre 's france team do not boast glorious form , far from it , despite the emphatic 29-0 victory over italy in rome last weekend .. crucially , that game took place 24 hours after england beat scotland and since then les bleus have had to fly home , patch themselves up and catch the eurostar to london , while also dealing with the distraction of a club v country row over fly-half camille lopez .. what the visitors will bring is physical presence .. the french are massive but this english pack has dealt with all-comers in recent times , and the graduated return of courtney lawes and parling in the second row should add dynamism and line-out nous to the mix .. nick easter could have a big role to play coming off the bench for england. courtney lawes should add dynamism to england 's back row. behind the packs , england are more settled and threatening .. jonathan joseph 's match-up with gael fickou will be intriguing , but only if the french threequarters are let off the leash .. ford can make holes in the gallic defence but england can not afford to be as wasteful as they were in beating scotland .. replacements could also have a big say and england will look to the likes of tom youngs and nick easter to generate momentum , tom wood to provide physicality and leadership , and richard wigglesworth to make an impact with his astute kicking game .. whether or not danny cipriani and billy twelvetrees play a part in a points chase , time will tell .. amid the maelstrom , the primary demand from lancaster will be for cool english heads .. robshaw should have plenty of leadership support , from parling and a raft of club captains in the ranks : joe marler and dylan hartley , james haskell and ben youngs .. there may be several rookies in white , but there are also enough established players .. together , they can ensure that the plot is not lost and that the ` main trophy ' is won .
( cnn ) wrapped up in a long brightly-colored scarf , which does little to contain her free-flowing curly hair , nneka sits back quietly as she tries to bring to mind her very first memory of music .. " i was a kid , " the nigerian singer finally says , her thoughts traveling back to warri , the niger delta city where she grew up .. " while i was doing my domestic work in the house , sweeping , waking up at 5am in the morning , there was this bird [ singing ] -- and i never forgot the melody , " she continues , breaking a warm smile .. " funny wise , like 25 years later i was in lagos and i heard the same melody -- it was amazing ! ". nneka 's first musical recollection might be firmly rooted in her birthplace , but the award-winning singer 's career was destined to begin thousands of miles away from home -- the daughter of a nigerian father and a german mother , nneka moved to hamburg at the age of 19 to study anthropology .. whilst attending university , she also started exploring her musical talents , and soon found herself performing in various clubs opening up for top reggae and hip-hop names .. in 2005 , she released " victim of truth , " a much-lauded debut that fused soulful beats , tasty hip-hop-and reflective ballads with politically-charged lyrics and black consciousness .. since then , she went on to enjoy further chart success , tour extensively and collaborate with global stars like lenny kravitz and damian marley .. and now , the soulful singer is back with a brand new , self-released album -- " my fairy tales " is a formidable collection of rich afrobeat grooves , reggae-tinged beats and uplifting rhythms that reaffirm her place as one of the continent 's most exciting -- and relevant -- artists .. cnn 's african voices caught up with nneka in london to talk about music , memories and the current situation in nigeria -- as well as present her with the questions you sent via the #asknneka and #cnnafrica hashtags .. cnn : in the past , you 've dealt with issues ranging from the environment and politics , to religion and love -- what are the themes that you 're emphasizing at this moment ?. nneka : what is happening in africa at present concerns me a lot .. boko haram has always been an issue obviously for the past five , six years -- funny wise , there 's a track in the album called " pray for you " which i recorded when not too many people knew what was going with boko haram in the west .. i 'm talking about the problems and possible solutions , and what are the reasons for the problems that we have .. we as nigerians , we 're not united , that has always been the issue ... that 's our problem , tribalism , and what belongs to whom .. i also talk about children and the future , bringing children into this world ... everyone 's living in a cage and then you bring your child into that kind of society , where your child is forced to live in fear .. people are afraid to express themselves politically , and even in their home -- i remember the way we grew up , i did n't look my father in the eye until i was 22 ; you call your father " sir , sir , sir " -- apparently it 's a form of respect , ok , but respect should not be mistaken with fear .. i was afraid and that 's the thing , that 's the colonial mentality : we mistake fear for respect .. he [ goodluck jonathan ] says he wants to tackle boko haram , obviously every nigerian is asking why now , he could had done it a long time ago ... but i 'm not good at the whole blaming game , i do n't want to blame anybody but i pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy .. but i know that fela [ kuti ] would definitely not be cool with him , seun [ kuti ] is not cool with him , and many other musicians who are very outspoken are not cool with him .. cnn : what is the power of music and how can it influence things to bring positive change ?. nneka : music is very powerful , music is big ; music is even more powerful than politics at present .. beyonce would definitely draw more crowd than [ nigerian president ] goodluck jonathan if she was going to hold a speech -- if beyonce is going to talk about boko haram , many people are going to listen , and if she had something to tell nigerians about love or whatever , many people are going to listen .. cnn : how do you see the political and security situation now in nigeria ?. nneka : all i can say is that we do need proper leadership .. yes , that 's just easier said than done , but we also need ourselves to take more things into our own hands -- so if we want change , we have to show that we want change , peacefully -- i love malcolm x but i 'd rather go for martin luther [ king ] -- peacefully .. and be part of it , not just blame our leaders and making sure that you , yourself , contribute to the change that you want to see .. nneka : my personal life always inspires me , in the first place , and then i try to expand it to the world .. i try not to go too personal so that people can have their own interpretation of the song and also relate to it in their own special way .. nneka : i like the prophet by kahlil gibran , i like things fall apart by chinua achebe , i like the bible .. right now i 'm reading the humans by matt haig .. just read , educate yourself !. nneka : the way forward is going to be easier said than done , but tribalism is not they key .. what we need is unity and to appreciate each other as nigerians , as africans , regardless of tribe and regardless of religion -- imposing your religion on other people is only going to create war and turmoil , there has to be another way .. nneka : being on tour for like five months ; i mean you get used to the life , but [ it 's hard ] when you 're coming back home and then realizing that people move on when you 're not around .. nneka : it is successfully already , that 's why everybody is in it .. that 's all i can say to that , it 's flourishing and they know it 's flourishing and that 's why they 're all there -- the chinese , the americans , the europeans and the rest of them .

kell brook is giving amir khan 48 hours to commit to a battle of britain at wembley stadium on june 13 , or else he will find another big name to be given the special k treatment this summer .. khan says sorry but he will be fighting in america next month , although he will oblige brook in due course .. brook 's promoter eddie hearn does not believe khan is scared of his man but said : ` amir 's family are not certain he would win the fight and realise that if he were to lose it would be game over for their boy . '. kell brook celebrates after beating jo jo dan during their ibf world welterweight title fight in sheffield. there was a whiff of mayweather-pacquiao in the saturday night air in sheffield after brook flexed the vivid scar in his left leg and vexed his six months of anxiety since that machete attack on an inadequate challenger for his ibf world welterweight title .. by keeping the world waiting for five years , the money man and the pacman have built their rivalry into a half-a-billion-dollar bonanza in las vegas on may 2 .. by keeping the united kingdom on tenterhooks for another 12 months , brook and khan can crank up the ante way beyond what hearn describes as ` the biggest pay-day of their lives . '. brook has called out amir khan for the ` battle of britain ' and gave the boxer 48 hours to commit. just so long as neither of them is beaten in the interim .. that risk will be difficult to evaluate until they each identify their next opponent .. brook is going to vegas to celebrate his 29th birthday by watching floyd and manny contest - the richest fight of all time .. he will throw down the gauntlet to the winner but has more realistic alternatives .. brook knocks down jo jo dan for the first time during the one-sided fight at the motorpoint arena. they include mexican legend juan manuel marquez in front of 40,000 of brook 's neighbours at sheffield united 's brammall lane football ground or tex-mex slugger brandon rios in the manchester arena or london 's 02 .. khan is hoping to announce a foe for somewhere in america sometime next month .. ideally puerto rican icon miguel cotto at catch-weight , maybe controversial adrien broner , or the less compelling recent pacquiao victim chris algieri .. in truth -- impressively though brook proved his full recovery from that bizarre machete attack in tenerife six months ago -- any of the above would provide sterner opposition than the canada-based romanian he employed as a punch-bag in the motorpoint arena this weekend .. the welterweight knocked dan around the ring like a rag doll and wants a big one against khan. jo jo dan became yo yo dan as he went down and up four times in the four one-sided rounds which ended in the inevitable stoppage .. as a homecoming party for brook after winning his world title in the us then almost losing his life in that deeply scarring assault , it was fun for all concerned except the hapless gent in the other corner .. desperate dan reeled around like a drunk as special k had him for breakfast , lunch and dinner at one sitting .. brook sends dan flying for a third time and then knocked him down a fourth before it was stopped. brook 's first right-hander wobbled him .. more of the same dropped him in the second round .. he somehow stayed upright in the third but the punishment was unrelenting and down he went twice more in the fourth .. the final knock-down came a split-second before what proved to be the final bell .. american referee earl brown conducted the required standing eight-count before ushering dan into his corner and then refusing him permission to come out again .. not brook 's fault since this was his mandatory challenger and he was right to point out that dan had not been stopped before .. wembley stadium has been booked for the fight by eddie hearn but its remains to be seen if khan accepts. although that does beg serious questions of the ibf rankings procedures .. dan reeled around like a drunk in the ring and it is arguable that brook might have found a tougher rival in the pub round the corner .. brook now rates himself up there with mayweather , pacquiao and khan among welterweight royalty .. hearn concurred with that opinion , saying : ` when kell first came to me his father told me he would beat mayweather one day .. now he is just one more big win away from fighting floyd . '. that victory will be easier to realise than the super fight in vegas , since anything other than an anti-climax on may 2 seems certain to result in a second-fortune rematch for mayweather and pacquiao in the autumn .. dan had no answer to the power and speed of brook whose recovered well from his stabbing. marquez is easing his ruptured knee back into training but is not certain to box again and will be expensive to bring to sheffield if he does .. so the greater likelihood is rios .. brook and his towns-folk would prefer it to be his fellow brit .. when he took the microphone to ask who they wanted him to beat next , the packed crowd roared : ` khan , khan , khan . '. brook celebrates after beating jo jo dan during their ibf world welterweight title fight. hearn would love that , too , and he believes it is also what the british fight fans desire .. but he says : ` if we do n't start talking for real in the next couple of days it will be too late for june 13 .. and i 'm not expecting my phone to ring within 48 hours .. they have already said that our fight will happen -- but not next . '. brook can rest easy on his world title and a left leg repaired by nuclear medicine .. having done all that was required of him to stay unbeaten all he needs to do now to bring the big bucks rolling in is stay out of trouble .

arsene wenger 's champions league record is as phenomenal as it is deeply disappointing .. the paradox is apparent is wenger 's own mantra , oft repeated , that the club 's record of qualifying for the tournament for 17 consecutive years and having reached the equivalent of knock-out stages for the last 15 years is extraordinary .. yet having contested the champions league and its predecessor the european cup 18 times now ( including twice at monaco ) , he has never won it .. perhaps more damningly he has been in the final just once and the semi-finals three times , once with monaco and twice with arsenal .. arsene wenger is undoubtedly one of the managerial greats but his european record is a blot on his cv. wenger leads his arsenal side against monaco on tuesday night hoping to turn around a 3-1 deficit. wenger looks towards the champions league trophy after losing the 2006 final to barcelona in paris. progression to the quarter-finals of the champions league would require arsenal to do what no other side has done in the champions league - overturn a two-goal home leg deficit .. so to inspire the team , arsenal fans have taken to twitter and created the hashtag #miracleinmonaco in the hope of inspiring their side to a famous victory , with the topic now trending worldwide .. supporters will hope mesut ozil and co can live up to their alter-egos from arsenal 's christmas party in 2013 where the squad dressed up as superheroes .. for a manager of such iconic status who for most of those years has overseen one of europe 's biggest and best-resourced clubs , that is a poor record , which points to his limitations .. just to be clear , before the debate immediately descends into a pro- or anti-wenger polemic , there are shades of grey in this argument .. wenger is undoubtedly one of the great managers and will always be revered as such .. but his failure to win any european trophy and to have contested just three finals in 22 years of qualifying for various european tournaments , is a glaring omission in his career .. it is why the game against monaco is so poignant .. it is not just that he is returning to where his european pedigree began .. it is the fact that this tie should have been the perfect platform for wenger to have another go at building a european success .. it has n't turned out that way after that awful , shambolic 3-1 defeat in the first leg at the emirates .. of course , should arsenal pull off the most unlikely of comebacks , it will rank as one of his greatest moments in the tournament .. more significantly , with real madrid faltering , wenger will feel his team , coming nicely into form , has a genuine chance of finally winning it .. few will agree with him though on analysing his record .. the failure clearly irks arsenal .. freddie ljungberg admitted as much last year , when interviewed about wenger .. for all the plaudits of the incredible invincible team , they themselves sense a gap in their cv .. ` when we meet up , the old players , we are very disappointed we have n't won the champions league , ' said ljungberg .. ` we felt we had a good enough team to win it .. personally that 's where i have my biggest regrets , because that was a few years that it happened , and internally , the team thought we had a great chance of winning . '. the closest wenger came to realising his dream was the champions league final in 2006 , when ten-man arsenal led until the 76th minute against barcelona .. who is to say that arsenal would n't have won that day had jens lehmann not been sent off ?. this is thrust of wenger 's argument when questioned on his record : that the fine margins and necessary luck which plays its part in football is to blame for him not having achieved his goal .. video monaco are favourite to progress. freddie ljungberg admitted that it was one of the biggest regrets for wenger 's great side to not win in europe. ashley cole reacts after arsenal lose out in paris , courtesy of goals from samuel eto'o and juliano belletti. thierry henry could not inspire arsenal to victory in wenger 's only european cup final back in 2006. it is compelling up to a point .. clearly wenger is an infinitely better coach than roberto di matteo and tony barton , both of whom have won the trophy .. but judged against his peers , the managerial greats of the modern era , wenger 's record is lacking .. leave aside for now the fact that bob paisley won the trophy three times in six attempts and brian clough won it twice in four attempts , in the modern era wenger 's does not rank among the elite group of coaches .. carlo ancelotti has won the trophy three times in twelve attempts ; jose mourinho has won it twice in eleven ( counting this season , as he is already out ) ; pep guardiola has won in twice in five attempts .. and even guardiola ca n't match jupp heynckes record of two wins and four finals in five attempts .. heynckes champions league ` nadir ' was going out in the semi-final to eventual winners red star belgrade in 1991 .. wenger looks on as barcelona lift the trophy - and he is still without a european trophy in his long career. jens lehmann was sent off early in the game and barcelona 's pressure eventually told as they beat arsenal. a persistent critique of sir alex ferguson 's ability as a coach ( as opposed to manager ) was that , given his resources he ` only ' won the trophy twice in 21 years .. he also qualified for the competition three times with aberdeen , but left them to join united midway through the 1985-86 competition .. monaco tonight is the reminder that wenger is the consummate qualifier in europe but never the victor .. in his six years here at the club , the team qualified for european competition every season , losing in the final of the cup-winners ' cup in 1992 to werder bremen .. remarkably , given the relative size of the club , they reached the champions league semi-finals in 1994 , losing 3-0 to ac milan .. no disgrace in that , however ; that was fabio capello 's team which proceeded to take apart barcelona 4-0 in the final .. carlo ancelotti has won the champions league three times , including last year , in twelve attempts. jose mourinho has won the big trophy twice in eleven entries ( counting this season , as he is already out ). jupp heynckes has a hugely impressive record of two wins and four finals in five champions league attempts. wenger 's gifts are undeniable .. but an 18-year sample should take account of bad luck and the statistical vagaries of football .. there is a missing link in wenger 's tactical psyche .. it is as evident in the defensive displays against chelsea and liverpool last season as it was against monaco two weeks ago .. it has always been there and it holds him back from being the very best .. the year he perhaps should have done it but did n't was not so much 2006 , when that team was beginning to decline , but the invincible year of 2003-04 , when a late wayne bridge goal at highbury knocked arsenal out in the quarter-finals in the days when wenger 's teams were considerably stronger than chelsea .. it is a difficult to remember a night when wenger has looked more disconsolate .. he seemed so full of fury that he was on the point of bursting into tears .. for all the professonial stereotypes , he is a deeply emotional man .. wayne bridge fired in a late chelsea winner at highbury in 2004 in one of arsenal 's best chances of winning. bridge 's goal defeated an arsenal side that were superior to chelsea and went on to win the premier league. wenger can not hide his disappointment as then-chelsea manager claudio ranieri celebrates a rare win. nothing would give english football lovers greater pleasure that to see arsenal execute a remarkable comeback tonight and for wenger to go on and finally lift the trophy ` with the big ears , ' as patrick vieira always called it .. or , at some stage in these , surely the final few years of his career , for him to achieve that goal .. his reputation demands it and on a sentimental level , having achieved so much , he 's earned it .. but the champions league is an unforgiving beast .. it may not be a perfect barometer of coaching ability , but it is quite a good , crude measure of how well you pit your wits against the best minds in football .. and wenger , for all his accolades , comes up short .. wenger is back at his former club monaco on tuesday night with the hope of reaching european glory

( cnn ) the odds seemed almost impossibly stacked against baby lily , but she survived .. rescuers found the toddler saturday , hanging upside down in her mother 's car , which had flipped into a frigid utah river a day before .. if the wreck occurred when police believe it did , she may have been there for as many as 14 hours .. lily 's mother , lynn jennifer groesbeck , died in the crash .. she was 25 years old .. how did her 18-month-old survive ?. one of the biggest factors was the car seat .. lily was in the proper car seat for her age and the seat appears to have been properly attached .. even though the child was trapped and upside down , her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water .. doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous , but would be even more so if the baby were wet .. dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures .. ironically , the cold might have actually helped lily survive , said dr. barbara walsh , with the university of massachusetts medical school .. " she 's going to have a lower heart rate .. she 's going to have a lower metabolism .. she 's going to need less sugar , " walsh said .. " it 's almost like the body is sort of knowing that it needs to shut down to protect itself . ". a variety of other factors were also likely at play .. " we do n't know what time the child was last fed , when she drank .. given that it 's wintertime and she was in her car seat , she was probably wearing mittens , a hat .. we tend to over bundle our children , so the fact that she was dry , she probably had on multiple layers because it 's winter , and there 's always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role , " walsh said .. a final factor may have been that the girl , as a toddler , has baby fat -- a little extra insulation .. if she had been an infant , it might have been a different story .. children are very resilient , and i think sometimes we do n't realize how much they actually can withstand , " said walsh .. cnn 's ben brumfield and nadia kounang contributed to this report .
as if he did n't already know , joe schmidt found out the hard way last saturday that 80 minutes can be a long time in rugby .. ireland were riding the crest of a wave arriving into cardiff .. ten successive wins and the grand slam there for the taking .. eighty minutes later , their unbeaten run was over and now they face the very real prospect of being left with nothing to show for their efforts in 2015 .. a year ago they had momentum going into the closing round of the championship .. they led the table with a huge points difference and , after england fell short of eclipsing that target in rome , there were no outside complications weighing on ireland 's mind in that evening 's tournament closer : beat france and the title was theirs .. jared payne ( left ) , iain henderson ( centre ) and jordi murphy warm-up during ireland training on thursday. ireland flanker sean o'brien fires out a backhand pass during ireland 's session at their base in carton house. jonathan sexton ( centre ) and his fellow irish players are gearing up for their crunch clash against scotland. twelve months later they are in an awkward bind -- second on points difference with no exact clarity on what type of win is needed to retain their title given that england will be last into action tomorrow .. adding to ireland 's anxiety is their inability to get over the try line .. whereas 16 were scored in the title run in 2014 run , there have been just four in 320 minutes this term .. schmidt , though , claims not to be worried about the drought , adding that a level of tolerance must be shown towards the development of his new midfield combination now that brian o'driscoll has retired and gordon d'arcy has been omitted for the six nations .. ` the game is very fickle , ' he claimed after announcing a team to play scotland showing two changes from wales with luke fitzgerald and cian healy getting in ahead of simon zebo and jack mcgrath .. ` one week you might score three tries and the next week you might not get any and you might have played better in the second week but you just did n't convert the opportunities .. ireland coach joe schmit will put his friendship with scotland boss vern cotter to one side on saturday. ` one of the frustrations from last week is that we did create three really clear try-scoring opportunities that we did n't convert .. last year , we converted a lot of our try-scoring opportunities .. they are the very fine margins .. ` trying to make sure we get on the right side of those margins all the time is difficult and it is something we 're working really hard on , ' claimed the attack coach whose specialist role in preparing the team is now under scrutiny as ireland 's meagre try tally is the joint worst in the tournament , level with france and seven tries fewer than top scorers england .. the lack of finishing power has cast a spotlight on the rookie centre pairing of jared payne and robbie henshaw .. ` jared does n't have a lot of test match experience but has played a lot of super and european rugby .. that breadth of experience and his maturity helps robbie work away .. ` brian o'driscoll does n't leave a team and suddenly there 's no deficit .. the guys who have come in in his place have done a super job , but they ca n't do the same job .. ` they 're doing the job with a different experience and a different knowledge of the game at that level .. i 'm not a patient man , i 'm not going to say that we 're being patient about it but we have to be a little bit tolerant of the development that needs to take place .. schmidt and cotter ( above ) worked together with clermont in france and in new zealand with bay of plenty. ` we do have a little inexperience at 12 but i do n't think you could fault robbie 's form right through the championship and he will grow into that first-receiver role when it 's demanded of him a little bit more as he gains experience .. ` one of the things i do feel we will get a benefit from is working our way through this championship .. having a loss , the first one in over a year , we need to stay balanced in how we 're preparing and do n't necessarily have to go too far away from what we 've been doing . '. schmidt , who revealed training on tuesday was as flat as it had ever been but was fresh on thursday , insists that guaranteeing victory in scotland -- not focusing on the margin of a potential win -- has been his approach , so much so that he admits he is n't much inclined to pass much heed of how wales fare in rome prior to saturday 's 2.30 pm start ( wales need a +22 win to have bettered ireland 's points difference ) .. it may well depend on what that margin is but i do n't think you try to do anything different .. you 're just looking to try to get the win ... and there 's no point trying to anticipate what the french-england result will be .. ` what will be really difficult is a really good scottish side .. they have narrow losses right through and have a better balance to their side this week .. it 's going to be a real challenge .. i 've read comments about how desperate they are to give an account of themselves that is sufficient to get them over the line .

the days of gooey toothpaste tubes , bottles of stubborn ketchup and sticky glue pots are numbered .. after unveiling its super slippery liquiglide coating last year , a team of massachusetts-based scientists has signed its first deal to bring the technology to supermarket shelves .. elmers brand glue an adhesives is the first firm to publicly announce a deal , and there are rumours a mayonnaise brand , and toothpaste company are also on board .. after unveiling its slippery liquiglide coating in a ketchup bottle last year ( pictured ) , its inventors have signed a deal to bring the technology to supermarket shelves .. elmers brand glue an adhesives is the first firm to sign up , and reports claim a mayonnaise brand , and toothpaste firm , are also on board. liquiglide was invented at mit and its designers call it ` the first and only permanently wet , slippery surface technology ' .. it is based on previous super-hydrophobic technology , but takes this a step further .. a conventional super-hydrophobic surface is similar to a lotus leaf - it is a highly textured surface that creates a cushion of air for the product to sit on .. but liquiglide replaces this ` cushion of air ' with a layer of liquid .. this so-called ` liquid-impregnated surface ' is a multi-layer surface consisting of a customised solid texture and a liquid .. the solid surface is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid , and the liquid is held in place to create the permanently slippery surface .. as a result , the ketchup , detergent or other product slides on the liquid layer , in a so-called ` liquid-to-liquid interface ' .. liquiglide was invented at mit and its designers call it ` the first and only permanently wet , slippery surface technology ' .. it is based on previous super-hydrophobic technology , but takes this a step further .. a conventional super-hydrophobic surface is similar to a lotus leaf - it is a highly textured surface which creates a cushion of air for the product to sit on .. but liquiglide replaces this ` cushion of air ' , or gas , with a layer of liquid .. a so-called ` liquid-impregnated surface ' is a multi-layer surface consisting of a customised solid texture and a liquid .. the surface ( illustrated ) is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid and keep it in place. the solid surface is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid and the liquid is held in place within the texture , creating a permanently slippery surface .. as a result , the ketchup , detergent or other product slides on the liquid layer , in a so-called ` liquid-to-liquid interface ' .. and by changing the material used , and the structure of the coating , the researchers can also control the the speed at which liquids slide over the surface .. the coating can also be made up of different materials , depending on the application .. for example , when fitted inside ketchup bottles the liquid is plant-based , while other non-food stuffs can use non-edible chemicals .. the firm said : ` first , we identify liquids that are compatible with the chemical and physical properties of our client 's product .. ` once we have found a suitable liquid , we select solid materials that are promising to adhere to the client 's surface and that will form a suitable porous structure .. ` the porous solid entraps the liquid through capillary forces .. ` these forces are sufficient to hold the liquid in place against forces greater than 50g .. ` once we have a prototype in place we create a scalable and commercially viable application process .. ` the end result : a durable and high performing coating that meets all the requirements of our client . '. and by changing the material used , and the structure of the coating , the researchers can also control the the speed at which liquids slide over the surface .. the non-toxic lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers and can be adapted for different applications .. a prototype liquiglide ketchup bottle came third in the inaugural visitor vote for the design museum 's designs of the year 2013 .. according to the inventors , each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers can not be scraped from jars and bottles , with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container .. liquiglide was invented at mit and its designers call it ` the first and only permanently wet , slippery surface technology ' .. a conventional super-hydrophobic surface ( left ) has a highly textured surface that creates a cushion of air to reduce friction , but liquiglide replaces this air with liquid ( right ). according to the inventors , each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers can not be scraped from jars and bottles , with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container .. the right-hand mustard bottle has been coated with liquidglide. they also claim that eliminating safety caps on squeeze bottles could save 50,000 tons of plastic a year .. not only does the product save waste and reduce the need for packaging , but it can also stop beer and fizzy drinks going flat .. the smoother surface created by coating the inside of cans and bottles for carbonated drinks with the substance slows the release of carbon dioxide bubbles from a drink , keeping it fizzy for longer .. the researchers can also control the speed of the liquid inside the container by changing the material used , and the structure of the coating .. this gif shows three different coatings and their respective speeds
today 's long awaited report into britain 's surveilance powers was sparked by the edward snowden revelations. gchq was last night cleared of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic .. the intelligence and security committee said the central claims made by the guardian newspaper on the back of documents stolen by american whistle-blower edward snowden were wrong and it cleared the government 's listening station of wrongdoing .. after an 18-month inquiry , the committee dismissed the claims that gchq had ` blanket coverage ' of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages .. in reality , it said , gchq can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ` tiny fraction ' of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process .. the committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the ` highest intelligence value ' , and these amounted to several thousand a day .. tory mp mark field , a member of the committee , said : ` the big mistake that snowden and the guardian made in its coverage was to equate bulk data with bulk surveillance .. ` the truth is that the filtering process means that a tiny proportion of the bulk data that is collected is ever examined .. ` that point was never really made by the guardian , who gave the impression that with every phone call , every email and every text message , the public had a spy on their shoulder . '. labour mp hazel blears said the ` two main claims ' made off the back of the snowden leaks were untrue and surveillance was neither blanket nor indiscriminate .. ` what we 've found is that the way in which the agencies use the capabilities they have is authorised , lawful , necessary and proportionate .. labour mp hazel blears chaired the press conference on the intelligence and security committee 's long-awaited report into britain 's spy agencies. gchq headquarters , based in cheltenham , is the government 's main listening post and is allowed to monitor people 's ` communications ' to uncover terror threats. ` but what we 've also found is there is a degree of confusion and lack of transparency about the way in which this is authorised in our legal system .. ` it is that lack of transparency that leads to people reaching the conclusion that there is blanket surveillance , indiscriminate surveillance . '. another committee member , tory mp dr julian lewis , compared the process to using a magnet to pull a needle from a haystack .. the agency does not have the ` legal authority , the resources or the technical capability ' to intercept such vast amounts of material , the report concluded .. the committee recommended a new law bringing together all the intelligence and security legislation .. ` the allegation arising from the [ snowden ] leaks is that gchq ` hoover up ' and collect all internet communications .. some of those who gave evidence to this inquiry said ` the agencies are monitoring the whole stream all the time ' , referring to the ` apparent ubiquity of surveillance ' .. ` we have explored whether this is the case .. it is clear that both for legal reasons and due to resource constraints , it is not : gchq can not conduct indiscriminate blanket interception of all communications .. ` it would be unlawful for them to do so , since it would not be necessary or proportionate , as required by [ the regulation of investigatory powers act ] .. moreover , gchq do not have the capacity to do so and can only cover a fraction of internet communications '. britain 's spy agencies have to get a warrant to monitor an individual 's emails , phone calls and other communications .. the warrants are signed off by the foreign secretary philip hammond ( left ) or home secretary theresa may ( right ). shami chakrabarti , director of rights campaign group liberty , said the parliamentary committee was ` clueless and ineffective '. councils were given more authorisations to access private communications data last year than gchq and mi6 , it emerged last night .. town halls accessed records of telephone , text or internet use 2,110 times last year , the interception of communications commissioner said .. that compares to 1,291 approvals for gchq and 652 for mi6 .. mi5 , which makes the vast bulk of such applications , was given 48,639 authorisations last year .. councils can use the powers to investigate fly tipping , benefit fraud , and trading standards ` crimes ' .. communities secretary eric pickles said : ` the use by some town halls seems excessive -- as if they were acting out their james bond fantasies .. i would encourage the press and public to investigate their actions further on why use is so high .. ` there is also a case for further tightening of these municipal snooping powers . '. snowden , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in hawaii , released 1.7 million files in one of the biggest security leaks in us history .. he fled to russia , where he was granted asylum .. shami chakrabarti , director of human rights group liberty , condemned the report , adding : ` no doubt it would be simpler if we went along with the spies ' motto of " no scrutiny for us , no privacy for you " -- but what an appalling deal for the british public . '. a guardian spokesman said : ` the snowden revelations provoked a global debate about the role of intelligence and surveillance in the free world , and the extent to which it should be the subject of democratic and judicial oversight .. following the recent investigatory powers tribunal ruling , it is now clear that the gchq and nsa mass surveillance programmes revealed by snowden were illegal . '. the committee found that mi5 , gchq and mi6 had all disciplined -- and in some cases sacked -- operatives for unapproved access .

one of at least four airmen captured by al qaeda militants after their syrian air force helicopter crash-landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric .. the pilot , who was captured near jabal al-zawiya in idlib province , is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi abdullah al-muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle .. al-muhaysini , who has long been affiliated with al qaeda-linked groups in syria , suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the syrian regime releases notorious jihadi abu mus ` ab as-suri , who is wanted in spain for suspected links to the 1985 el descanso and 2004 madrid bombings .. fear : the captured pilot is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi abdullah al-muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle. threatened : the pilot , who was captured near jabal al-zawiya in idlib province yesterday , appeared in the video released by al qaeda-linked militants from jabhat al-nusra this morning. the video shows the airman looking dazed as he sits on the floor of a darkened room with the notorious black and white banner of al qaeda 's syrian affiliate jabhat al-nusra behind him .. clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash , the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head .. the footage is decidedly amateur , is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick , professionally edited videos put out by nusra 's rival jihadi group islamic state .. nevertheless , the sight of al-muhaysini standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any isis release .. al-muhaysini 's primary demand is that the syrian regime release abu mus ` ab as-suri - a notorious al qaeda linked militant who was arrested in pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland .. aleppo-born as-suri - who holds spanish citizenship remains a wanted man in spain on suspicion of taking part in the islamic jihad organization 's 1985 bombing at madrid 's el descanso restaurant , which left 18 dead .. he is also wanted as a possible witness to the al qaeda-inspired coordinated bombings on the madrid 's train system , which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in march 2004 .. ` technical malfunction ' : people gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to syrian regime forces that crashed in jabal al-zawiya yesterday. gathered around : islamist rebels captured four crew members when the helicopter crashed , the syrian observatory for human rights said. the airman was one of six people on board the syrian air force helicopter when it crashed in a rebel-held area of north-western syria , near jabal al-zawiya in idlib province yesterday .. it experienced a technical malfunction and made an emergency crash-landing according to the uk-based syrian observatory for human rights .. syria 's state news agency confirmed that a helicopter had crashed after a mechanical problem and said the authorities were looking for the crew .. the sohr stated that opposition fighters , including from the al qaeda-affiliated nusra front , had taken four crew members prisoner .. another airman survived the crash but was reportedly killed by his captors , and the fate of a suspected sixth airman is unknown , the observatory said .. sohr head rami abdel rahman said : ` a regime helicopter was forced to land in the region of jabal al-zawiya in the north-west , which is a bastion of ( al-qaeda 's syrian affiliate ) al-nusra front .. ` four of the crew were captured and a fifth man was killed by armed men in a neighbouring village .

radamel falcao 's miserable career at manchester united reached a new low on tuesday night when he was dumped in the reserves by manager louis van gaal .. falcao has not played a minute of football for united 's first team since being dragged off midway through the home victory over sunderland last month and was left on the bench as van gaal 's stuttering team were knocked out of the fa cup by arsenal at home on monday night .. now the # 250,000-a-week loan signing from monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the under 21 team in their game against tottenham on tuesday night .. radamel falcao losing his footing as he tries to escape the attentions of bongani khumalo ( left ). falcao reacts as a chance goes by ( left ) while rafael ( right , centre ) is congratulated on his goal. falcao 's spectacular fall from favour is starkly shown by the ` u21 ' badge on the arm of his united shirt. van gaal 's decision to select the 29-year-old in the under 21s is indicative of the united manager 's ongoing concerns over the colombian international 's fitness levels .. however , the united boss usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury .. falcao has been injury free since recovering from a thigh injury at the end of november and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level at a time when he is desperately trying to prove he is worth a permanent deal .. united officials say falcao , one of the most feared strikers in world football before he suffered a cruciate ligament injury last january , was chosen to ensure he would be sharp for the first-team 's clash with spurs at the same venue on sunday afternoon .. falcao heads the ball towards goal but his drought goes on after another unsuccessful outing. sportsmail reported earlier this year that falcao feels he has to work twice as hard to impress his manager as some other players and has been less than thrilled at times to hear his manager question his fitness levels .. but on this evidence he will do well to win a recall from louis van gaal after an anonymous performance .. in a poor first half falcao dallied too long on two opportunities and his only other action of note came when he deflected fellow striker james wilson 's goal-bound effort wide from an offside position .. united coaches ( left-right ) paul mcguinness ( u18s ) , ryan giggs , nicky butt and tony strudwick ( fitness ) watch on. falcao looks to get in between the tottenham defence at old trafford as united are held by spurs. falcao has another effort on goal but is again frustrated as united searched for the winner. expertly marshalled by spurs ' centre-half pairing of 17-year-old cameron carter-vickers and south african bongani khumalo , 28 , the monaco man cut a desperately frustrated figure .. in the second half he was at it again when he diverted sean goss 's shot into the arms of spurs keeper luke mcgee before his disappointing evening came to a merciful end .. in contrast brazilian right back rafael , fighting for his future at united , was a standout .. he calmly intercepted mcgee 's throw out before chipping him with his left foot from 30 yards on 33 minutes to cancel out lively spurs midfielder kenny mcevoy 's opener .. having only scored four times during his six months at united , the chances of falcao being retained in the summer are almost nil .. united have not seen enough to suggest he will prove value for money in the long run while falcao feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by van gaal .. after monday 's cup exit against arsenal , van gaal reacted with irritation when asked about the decision to sign falcao and release danny welbeck last august .. welbeck returned to old trafford to score the winner in arsenal 's 2-1 win .. last night welbeck said : ` manchester united is a club that means so much to me .. i 'm a fan and it 's hard to knock them out .. i 'll always respect the fans .. i had a lovely reception from them and i 'm thankful for that .

england 's hopes of landing their first grand slam of stuart lancaster 's reign have been dashed again as ireland deservedly earned a victory that leaves them red-hot favourites to retain their six nations title .. lancaster 's men rarely threatened reproduce the form that saw them open the championship with wins over wales and italy as robbie henshaw 's second-half try , allied to 14 points from the boot of jonny sexton , inflicted a demoralising defeat on the visitors .. england travelled across the irish sea with high hopes of making it three wins from three but were persistently penalised at the breakdown by referee craig joubert as they struggled to gain a foothold in the match .. video - scroll down to see clips from the game. robbie henshaw ( left ) goes over the line to score a try for ireland and take the game away from england in the six nations. henshaw ( left ) had to collect a high ball to go over for the opening try , which was scored in the 52nd minute of the game. henshaw 's ( right ) try brought the aviva stadium to life as ireland beat england in style in the six nations. england 's players look dejected after they conceded the opening try of the match against ireland and henshaw. henshaw ( centre ) is congratulated by his ireland team-mate jared payne after scoring the try against england. while not as comprehensive as the 2013 defeat to wales at the millennium stadium , or indeed their loss to ireland on the same aviva stadium turf in 2011 , in some ways this was just as demoralising in a home world cup year .. there were some fine individual performances from england , with billy vunipola outstanding at no8 , but collectively the visitors were no match for joe schmidt 's unbeaten irish .. england , desperate for some silverware three years into lancaster 's tenure , must now regroup to face scotland and france at twickenham but they will do in the knowledge their grand slam hopes have been shattered again .. they retain a small chance of winning the championship , but that will prove of little comfort in the light of this comprehensive defeat .. dublin was lashed by wind , rain and sleet in the hours before kick off but mercifully the weather relented to leave the aviva stadium pitch slippery but not treacherous .. england had made two changes to their starting line-up from the side that beat italy a fortnight ago with jack nowell preferred to jonny may on the left wing and alex goode replacing mike brown after the harlequins full back failed to recover from concussion he suffered against the azzurri .. johnny sexton was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for ireland 's victory. richard wrigglesworth ( left ) , george kruis and chris robhaw react to england 's defeat

cole , attwood , kruis , haskell , robshaw , b vunipola .. penalties : ford ( 2 ). jordi murphy was ireland 's only change as he started at no8 in place of jamie heaslip , who is recovering from the broken vertebra in his back , caused by an intentional knee from france lock pascal pape which led to a 10-week ban .. ireland went into the game on the back of a nine-match winning run , including autumn victories over australia and south africa , while england were buoyed by a four-game unbeaten run against today 's hosts .. england were desperate to avoid another slow start after going behind in both their first two games of the championship but , following a lengthy pre-match build up which left the players on the field for several minutes prior to kick off , they were sluggish out of the blocks again .. george ford turned over the ball on the half-way line seconds after kick off and james haskell infringed at the breakdown after ireland whipped the ball wide down the left .. jonny sexton kicked the penalty from 40 metres , with barely two minutes on the clock , before england conceded another penalty from the kick off and ireland roared back into their opponents half .. with the capacity crowd behind ireland , sexton hoisted an awkward cross kick which nowell was unable to gather and the irish forwards thundered at england with wave after wave of attacks .. another penalty was conceded under the posts , which sexton converted , as england found themselves 6-0 down having barely drawn breath .. the visitors finally gained some sustained possession and ford was influential in stretching the irish defence as luther burrell and ben youngs both made telling incursions before the england fly half slotted a neat drop goal on 12 minutes to get his side on the scoreboard .. ford missed a long-range penalty attempt and england blew another excellent chance after fine build-up play saw ford kick a penalty to touch only for dylan hartley to throw straight to devin toner and allow ireland to clear .. alex goode ( centre ) blasts the ball clear to relieve the pressure on england from ireland in the six nations game. sexton ( right ) of ireland tackles ford

for possession. dave attwood ( upper left ) of england wins the line-out ball under pressure from peter o'mahoney ( right ) of ireland. george ford replied for england but stuart lancaster 's side could not run ireland close in the game at the aviva stadium. ireland flanker sean o'brien was taken off after 24 minutes after he was seen lying prone on the floor before attempting to stand up , only to lurch and stagger alarmingly as he battled the medics to stay on .. the flanker did not return .. sexton kicked his third penalty as ireland went 9-3 in front with 30 minutes gone but the fly half could not stretch ireland 's lead further when he missed a difficult penalty attempt after anthony watson was penalised for off-side .. ireland took a six-point lead in at half time as england clung on after 40 minutes that saw that repeatedly penalised by south african referee craig joubert .. ireland were fastest out of the blocks in the second half and a sharp break by conor murray saw robbie henshaw hack through only for goode to save the day for england with some brilliant defensive work behind the posts .. joubert again penalised england at the breakdown on 47 minutes and sexton extended his side 's lead to nine points with his fourth penalty and ireland struck the killer blow when murray chiped deep into england 's dead-ball area and henshaw out-jumped goode to touch down .. robbie henshaw ( left ) receives treatment during the game against england but was fit enough to continue and score a try for ireland. both sides new that victory would give them the upper hand in the race to win the rbs six nations. england 's players line up for the national anthem prior to the start of their game against ireland at the aviva stadium. sexton 's conversion made it 19-3 after 53 minutes and it was impossible to see a way back for england .. ford added his first penalty to chip away at ireland 's lead after a bulldozing run by billy vunipola and gave his side hope after 67 minutes with another three points. it proved a false hope as ireland held on .. even jack nowell 's late try attempt was chalked off when joubert spotted a forward pass .. it summed up england 's day .

( cnn ) at first glance esther okade seems like a normal 10-year-old .. she loves dressing up as elsa from " frozen , " playing with barbie dolls and going to the park or shopping .. but what makes the british-nigerian youngster stand out is the fact that she 's also a university undergraduate .. esther , from walsall , an industrial town in the uk 's west midlands region , is one of the country 's youngest college freshmen .. the talented 10-year-old enrolled at the open university , a uk-based distance learning college , in january and is already top of the class , having recently scored 100 % in a recent exam .. " it 's so interesting .. it has the type of maths i love .. it 's real maths -- theories , complex numbers , all that type of stuff , " she giggles .. " it was super easy .. my mum taught me in a nice way . ". she adds : " i want to ( finish the course ) in two years .. then i 'm going to do my phd in financial maths when i 'm 13 .. i want to have my own bank by the time i 'm 15 because i like numbers and i like people and banking is a great way to help people . ". and in case people think her parents have pushed her into starting university early , esther emphatically disagrees .. " i actually wanted to start when i was seven .. but my mum was like , " you 're too young , calm down . ". after three years of begging , mother efe finally agreed to explore the idea .. esther has always jumped ahead of her peers .. she sat her first math gsce exam , a british high school qualification , at ounsdale high school in wolverhampton at just six , where she received a c-grade .. a year later , she outdid herself and got the a-grade she wanted .. then last year she scored a b-grade when she sat the math a-level exam .. esther 's mother noticed her daughter 's flair for figures shortly after she began homeschooling her at the age of three .. initially , esther 's parents had enrolled her in a private school but after a few short weeks , the pair began noticing changes in the usually-vibrant youngster .. efe says : " one day we were coming back home and she burst out in tears and she said ' i do n't ever want to go back to that school -- they do n't even let me talk ! '. " in the uk , you do n't have to start school until you are five .. education is not compulsory until that age so i thought ok , we 'll be doing little things at home until then .. maybe by the time she 's five she will change her mind . ". efe started by teaching basic number skills but esther was miles ahead .. by four , her natural aptitude for maths had seen the eager student move on to algebra and quadratic equations .. and esther is n't the only maths prodigy in the family .. her younger brother isaiah , 6 , will soon be sitting his first a-level exam in june .. not content with breaking barriers to attend college at just 10 years old , esther is also writing a series of math workbooks for children called " yummy yummy algebra . ". " it starts at a beginner level -- that 's volume one .. but then there will be volume two , and volume three , and then volume four .. but i 've only written the first one .. " as long as you can add or subtract , you 'll be able to do it .. i want to show other children they are special , " she says .. meanwhile , esther 's parents are also trying to trail blaze their own educational journey back in nigeria .. the couple have set up a foundation and are in the process of building a nursery and primary school in nigeria 's delta region ( where the family are from ) .. named " shakespeare 's academy , " they hope to open the school 's doors in september .. the proposed curriculum will have all the usual subjects such as english , languages , math and science , as well as more unconventional additions including morality and ethics , public speaking , entrepreneurship and etiquette .. the couple say they want to emulate the teaching methods that worked for their children rather than focus on one way of learning .. " some children learn very well with kinesthetics where they learn with their hands -- when they draw they remember things .. some children have extremely creative imaginations .. instead of trying to make children learn one way , you teach them based on their learning style , " explains efe .. the educational facility will have a capacity of 2,000 to 2,500 students with up to 30 % of students being local children offered scholarships to attend .. efe says : " on one hand , billions of dollars worth of crude oil is pumped out from that region on a monthly basis and yet the poverty rate of the indigenous community is astronomical . ". while paul adds : " ( the region has ) poor quality of nursery and primary education .. so by the time the children get secondary education they have n't got a clue .. they have n't developed their core skills .. " the school is designed to give children an aim so they can study for something , not just for the sake of acquiring certifications .. there is an end goal .

( cnn ) real madrid 's star-studded attacking force might be struggling to fire , but barcelona coach luis enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front .. sunday 's 6-1 demolition of rayo vallecano put the catalan side one point above real at the top of spain 's la liga , with lionel messi setting more records as he netted a hat-trick while fellow forward luis suarez also scored twice .. even without suspended brazil star neymar -- the third prong of barca 's striking line -- enrique was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in madrid wounds following saturday 's 1-0 defeat at athletic bilbao .. " we 're elated , but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season .. i already said that everybody could lose a game , so we have to keep playing well and win every match , " he said .. " it 's heavy having to win every single match .. each game is more important than the last . ". by contrast , real coach carlo ancelotti is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against villarreal .. " there is no link-up play , our play is too based around individual play , we need another way of attacking , with faster play and fewer touches , " said the italian , who must rouse his troops for tuesday 's european champions league last-16 , second-leg tie at home to schalke .. " it is quite confusing to see what we 're doing at the moment in attack .. the ball does n't move around quickly . ". while real 's front trio of top scorer cristiano ronaldo , karim benzema and gareth bale are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season , barca 's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams ' " el clasico " clash at the nou camp in a fortnight .. messi 's 32nd career hat-trick is a record for a spanish club player , and took him past ronaldo as the la liga leader on 24 trebles .. the argentina star also drew level with the portugal captain as the spanish league 's top scorer this season on 30 goals .. it 's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals , with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign .. suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games , and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from english club liverpool after a world cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on italy 's giorgio chiellini .. " suarez and messi are having more and more chemistry , and today we all saw what they bring to the team , " enrique said .. " i like ( ivan ) rakitic wherever he plays on the field .. he always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we 've ever had . " ". ( gerard ) piqué has always known how to score , above all on set plays .. it 's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively . ". both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000 , barca 's best this season : rayo defender tito for a foul on suarez in the 55th minute that allowed messi to make it 3-0 with a retaken penalty ; and dani alves for tripping alberto bueno , who also netted the resulting spot-kick .. barca 's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third-placed atletico madrid after the defending champion 's 1-1 home draw with fourth-placed valencia later sunday .. koke put atletico ahead in the first half but shkodran mustafi headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left , while valencia teammate javi fuego received two late yellow cards .. sixth-placed villarreal beat celta vigo 4-0 , while real sociedad beat espanyol 1-0 in a mid-table clash .. in italy , second-placed roma missed a chance to put pressure on leader juventus after being held 0-0 at struggling chievo verona on sunday .. it left rudi garcia 's team eight points adrift of juve , which hosts sassuolo on monday .. third-placed napoli also drew , blowing a two-goal lead against inter milan as rodrigo palacio and mauro icardi , with an 87th-minute penalty , canceled out second-half goals by marek hamsik and gonzalo higuain .. in germany , bayer leverkusen moved up to fourth with a 3-0 win at paderborn as south korea striker heung-min son scored two late goals after a 73rd-minute opener from greece defender kyriakos papadopoulos .. in france , lyon restored a one-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win at montpellier , as young midfielder nabil fekir scored twice .. in england , premier league side liverpool faces an fa cup replay after being held 0-0 by second-tier blackburn .
you do n't restrict an artist .. he 's there to create , to entertain , to slap his imagination on a blank canvas and leave the world wondering how the hell he did it .. louis van gaal used juan mata as a ` false right winger ' at anfield six days ago , and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by david moyes and jose mourinho .. the two-time chelsea player of the year showed good things come to those who wait , as liverpool 's 3-4-3 formation that snookered teams from january onward was lost on manchester united .. manchester united midfielder juan mata scores the second of his double to seal an important win at anfield. mata 's perfect technique for his scissor-kick was brilliant as he scored one of the goals of the season. liverpool could do little to stop mata 's incredible scissor-kick giving them a 2-0 lead at anfield. mata runs away in celebration with united team-mates marouane fellaini ( right ) and wayne rooney ( left ). it was , if nothing else , unexpected .. mata had gone unused , having played just 15 minutes across four premier league games in february , and it was reminiscent of his bit-part role at chelsea .. mourinho considered oscar a better fit as his no 10 , believing mata 's defensive cover left a lot to be desired .. he is not a tackler , nor is he the physical type .. you do n't buy a jack russell terrier then expect it to behave like an american pit bull .. mata is a different breed .. what he is , is an architect .. since the start of the 2011-12 barclays premier league season , he has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder .. close behind is manchester city 's david silva ( 63 ) and yaya toure ( 61 ) , then chelsea 's eden hazard and liverpool 's steven gerrard ( both 58 ) .. yet his defensive discipline -- or lack thereof -- is what mourinho considered his achilles heel .. it 's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles ( 0.64 ) , clearances ( 0.16 ) and duels won ( 14.29 per cent ) per game when he , silva , toure , hazard and gerrard are compared , but that 's not his job .. mata left chelsea for united in a # 37m switch but manager david moyes never got his money 's worth. mata 's prayers have been answered at united as he looks to get a regular run out by louis van gaal. only silva ( 365 ) beats him in chances created out of the entire premier league since the beginning of 2011-12 , but mata ( 291 ) has played 466 fewer minutes .. he 's the creative kind , but would most likely still be warming the substitutes ' bench at stamford bridge had he not swapped south for north .. it was moyes that bought mata from chelsea , phoning him personally to explain what he wanted .. fluidity , assists and goals were the demands , and mata agreed .. two days later , he arrived at carrington -- by helicopter , no less -- and it was confirmed .. chelsea made a tidy # 13.5 m from the mata move .. shrewd as ever , as they were with david luiz ( # 31.6 m profit ) , andre schurrle ( # 4m ) , kevin de bruyne ( # 11m ) , romelu lukaku ( # 18m ) and thorgan hazard ( # 5.5 m ) , among others .. moyes , however , never got his money 's worth .. mata celebrates his goal with team-mate daley blind at anfield on sunday during their win. mata has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder in the premier league since 2011. it was when he left manchester with the club in seventh that the inquest began .. he had n't kept sir alex ferguson 's backroom staff .. he failed to replace nemanja vidic , rio ferdinand , ryan giggs and patrice evra .. his style of football was cautious , slow and predictable compared to his predecessor 's attacking outlook .. another supposed error was wasting # 64m on marouane fellaini and mata .. yet the new man at manchester united is getting what moyes could n't out of both .. against liverpool , fellaini and mata covered the most distance ( 11.6 km each ) out of everyone .. mata had more touches ( 93 ) than anyone else , made 73 passes with 91.8 per cent accuracy , and made hazard proud by drawing more fouls than any other player ( 3 ) .. for a player without a shot on target in the premier league since december 20 , he scored two goals worthy of settling the great rivalry .. alberto moreno , lugging five yards behind for mata 's first and not tracking him for the second , was tormented by the man that goes by ` johnny kills ' -- a suitable nickname handed to him by former chelsea team-mate daniel sturridge because it is a literal translation of his name .. juan mata 's heat map from manchester united 's 2-1 win at liverpool last weekend. alberto moreno was tormented by mata at anfield but the challenge is for him to make it consistent. mata runs with the ball during the tense match between the two great rivals of the premier league. united 's average positions vs liverpool ( left ) with mata ( no 8 ) drifting inside ... and his total passes ( right ). mata 's heat map vs tottenham hotspur on march 15 in united 's 3-0 win at old trafford saw him drift inside. jan 1 vs stoke - 90 minutes. jan 11 vs southampton - 90. jan 17 vs qpr - 45. jan 31 vs leicester - 13. feb 8 vs west ham - 0. feb 11 vs burnley - 0. feb 21 vs swansea - 11. feb 28 vs sunderland - 4. march 4 vs newcastle - 8. march 15 vs tottenham - 77. march 22 vs liverpool - 90. against liverpool , right-back antonio valencia was used as cover , sprinting up the wing to allow mata to abandon his post .. those two exchanged more passes ( 55 ) than anyone else on sunday , and worked in tandem .. their average positions show mata ( no 8 ) stayed close to ander herrera ( no 21 ) , who was equally devastating at anfield , while valencia ( no 25 ) pushed up , just short of the half-way line .. mata played a similar role against tottenham hotspur the week before , as his almost identical heat maps above demonstrate .. but he is not out of the woods yet .. mata is flirting with a first-team place , having replaced an out-of-sorts angel di maria , but the trick is to stay there .. he has been crying out for this , ever since he was phased out at chelsea , and even more so now he has been dropped by spain .. mata has played 3,724 minutes and made 44 starts in the past two seasons .. restricted , to say the least , when compared to former chelsea team-mate hazard , who has 5,461 minutes and 61 starts .. it 's easier said than done to become a must-pick -- # 37m does n't buy you that luxury these days .. can it happen at manchester united ?. if mata can rip teams to shreds as he did against liverpool , then how can it not ?. trouble is , louis van gaal -- like jose mourinho -- is a hard man to please .. mata has played 3,724 minutes with 44 starts over the last two seasons - far less than his counterparts. mata ripped liverpool apart on sunday as they ended their unbeaten run in the premier league in 2015

( cnn ) lee kuan yew will forever be remembered as the man who transformed a mosquito-ridden colonial trading post into a prosperous financial center with clean streets , shimmering skyscrapers and a stable government .. born in 1923 , lee became prime minister in 1959 when singapore , a tiny spit of land with no natural resources and a polyglot population of chinese , malays and indians , was still british territory and beset by riots and unrest .. he presided over singapore 's bitter split from malaysia in 1965 and molded the independent country into the global economic powerhouse it is today .. " i was trying to create , in a third-world situation , a first-world oasis , " lee told cnn in 2008 .. read more : obama : ` lee a visionary '. lee 's thinking also had an international impact .. his brand of capitalism -- which stresses the role of government rather than the free hand of the market -- has provided a blueprint for china 's landmark economic reforms .. but lee was also a divisive figure , attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents .. in 2013 , protests over plans to allow more immigrants into the city-state indicated growing unease among singaporeans about the vision of the country set forth by the people 's action party -- the party co-founded by lee that has ruled singapore for five decades .. lee voluntarily stepped down as prime minister in 1990 , the first asian strongman to do so .. however , he played a role in the country 's cabinet until 2011 when his eldest son , lee hsien loong , was elected for a second term as prime minister .. the elder lee retained his influence around the world .. " this is one of the legendary figures of asia in the 20th and 21st centuries , " u.s. president barack obama said during a meeting with lee at the white house in october 2009 .. " he is somebody who helped to trigger the asian economic miracle , " obama added .. but there were indications lee 's health had been slipping in recent years .. in 2010 he was admitted to the hospital with a chest infection and in early 2013 , lee -- then 89 -- was hospitalized and treated treated for " stroke-like symptoms . ". he was again admitted to the hospital on february 5 for severe pneumonia and more than six weeks later remained on a ventilator .. a fourth-generation singaporean , lee 's family originally emigrated from southern china .. a bright student , he gained a place in the city 's elite raffles institution and went on to study law at fitzwilliam college at cambridge .. he attributed his decision to go into politics to his experiences during the japanese occupation of singapore .. " i learned how people survived and how people had to submit because you need to eat and your family needs to live , so i learned the meaning of power , " he told cnn in 2002 .. the city lee took control of in 1959 was still recovering from the ravages of war and could not have been more different from today 's singapore .. however , lee told cnn he had no " great vision of transformation . ". he concentrated on attracting investment and creating jobs ; first finding a successful niche in electronics manufacturing by touting singapore as an alternative to hong kong , which he said was in turmoil due to the cultural revolution in china .. while lee has been lauded for his economic accomplishments , he also created a singapore bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most , if not all , aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms , censorship and even the selling of chewing gum .. the country ranks 150th in reporters without borders ' 2014 media freedom index , putting it just above the democratic republic of congo , mexico and iraq .. the new york times , the economist , the international herald tribune and the asian wall street journal have all been targeted with the " judicial harassment " employed by the lee family , according to the media watchdog .. in a 2014 article for cnn , opposition politician dr. chee soon juan criticized singapore 's authoritarian system , blaming a lack of dissenting views for economic inequality and worsening working conditions .. " the ranks of the opposition , civil society and labor movement have been decimated in the last 50 years through imprisonment without trial and criminal prosecution , and nearly every newspaper , tv channel and radio station is owned and run by the state , " chee said .. but in a 2008 interview with cnn 's fareed zakaria , lee rebuffed charges that singapore was too domineering or coercive a state .. " i want social peace and stability within the country .. i am not following any prescription given to me by any theoretician on democracy , " he said .. while lee is likely to be remembered with affection and pride by many singaporeans , a younger generation , with no memory of the poverty and violence that marked the country 's birth , is questioning the lee dynasty 's control of singaporean politics and pushing for greater democracy .. in 2011 , the people 's action party lost six seats to the opposition , prompting lee , then the party 's " minister mentor " and another former prime minister , goh chok tong , to resign .. in a joint letter to parliament , the two explained they " decided to leave the cabinet and have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation in shaping the future of our singapore . ". how singapore copes with these democratic demands will be key to its success in its second half-century , but those demands are unlikely to detract from lee 's achievements in its first 50 years .. in 2010 , time magazine listed lee as one of world 's 100 most influential people .. " the mark of a great leader is to take his society from where it is to where it has never been , " wrote former u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger in the article on lee .. " there is no better strategic thinker in the world today . "

pilot jan cocheret wrote at the beginning of the year about his fear of being locked out of the cockpit after visiting the aircraft 's toilet. a dutch pilot ` predicted ' the germanwings crash several weeks ago in an article written in a specialist flight magazine posing the question : ' i seriously wonder who 's sitting next to me . '. chillingly jan cocheret , who flies a boeing 777 for emirates airlines warned : ' i hope i never find myself in the situation where i go to the toilet and return to find a cockpit door that wo n't open . '. mr cocheret was writing for dutch flying magazine piloot en vliegtuig ( pilot and plane ) where he expressed his fears .. his article warned that someone could use the security procedures introduced in the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities to prevent an aircraft 's captain re-entering the flight deck after a rest break .. french prosecutors have determined that andreas lubitz waited for his captain to leave the flight deck before disabiling key pad controlling access to the cockpit .. he then selected an altitude of 96 feet on the aircraft 's flight computer before setting it on its collision course with the alps .. investigators revealed that the aircraft 's captain patrick sondenheimer can be heard banging on the cockpit door urging his colleague to open up until the jet hits the alps at more than 400 miles per hour .. audio leading up to the crash revealed that captain sondenheimer had complained that he did not have enough time to use the toilet while the aircraft was on the ground in barcelona .. as soon as the aircraft achieved its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , captain sondenheimer can be heard leaving the cockpit .. as soon as the door closed behind him , lubitz flicked a switch which disabled the keypad on the cabin side of the door for five minutes and initiated his descent .. the door lock override is switched off after five minutes as an additional safety measure in case the flight crew become incapacitated .. lubitz is believed to have flicked the switch a second time during the eight-minute descent .. mr cocheret later wrote on his facebook page : ` unfortuantely , this terrible scenario has become a reality .

'. german airline lufthansa has set aside $ 300 million to deal with potential civil claims against the company following the germanwings disaster .. the french crash investigators bea said they will look into methods of preventing a similar incident in future .. a spokesperson said : ' ( we will study ) systemic weaknesses ( that ) might possibly have led to this aviation disaster . '. german officials have revealed that lubitz , 27 , received psychotherapy before gaining his pilot 's licence after expressing suicidal tendencies .. crash investigators are trying to build a road to the site of the crash to help speed up recovery efforts and attempts to find the second black box .. lufthansa has so far refused to say whether they were aware of lubitz 's mental health history although they said he had passed all the required medical tests to work with germanwings , its low-cost subsidiary .

taking statins ( pictured ) can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown. taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown .. the cholesterol-lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes .. the risk , which is far higher than previously believed , has prompted fresh concern about the side effects of the pills .. the findings are particularly worrying as last year the nhs recommended that up to 17million adults should be on statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes .. the drugs ' rationing body nice published guidance last july urging gps to prescribe them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease in a decade .. this represents around 40 per cent of adults in the uk , and academics said the advice was ` foolhardy ' when so little was known about the side effects .. in the latest study , scientists from the university of eastern finland studied 8,749 men aged 45 to 73 over a six-year period .. just under a quarter were taking statins when the study started .. some had only been on the pills for a few months , others for several years .. over the course of the study , the scientists found that taking statins increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 46 per cent .. their research , published in the journal diabetologia , found that statins reduced the ability of insulin to break down blood sugar .. this is known as insulin sensitivity , and was on average 24.3 per cent lower in men who were taking statins .. the cholesterol-lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes. the researchers believe that if insulin does not break down blood sugar , and the body 's sugar levels rise too high , then it can trigger type 2 diabetes .. they concluded : ` statin therapy was associated with a 46 per cent increased risk of type 2 diabetes .. ` the association of statin use with increased risk of developing diabetes is most likely directly related to statins decreasing both insulin sensitivity and secretion . '. dr aseem malhotra , a consultant cardiologist in london , said that contrary to the nhs guidance , healthy adults should not be taking statins , adding : ` i personally would n't take it or recommend it to friend or family member who is otherwise healthy but let them make up their own minds after giving them all the information .. ` eating a handful of nuts or four tablespoons of olive oil may be a more effective way at reducing risk of a heart attack , stroke or death and without the side effects . '. professor peter weissberg , medical director at the british heart foundation , said healthy patients prescribed statins to prevent heart disease should take the ` lowest possible dose ' .. he went on to warn that people with existing heart conditions should not stop taking the pills , saying : ` it is important that people taking statins because of existing cardiovascular disease should continue to take them as the benefits will outweigh the risks .

stuart lancaster 's side have an excellent chance of claiming an unlikely championship title if they can see off france more convincingly than ireland beat scotland or wales beat italy .. but the display was strewn with errors and england delivered less than they should have done , although there were positive signs .. england captain chris robshaw lifts the calcutta cup after england beat scotland , but it was a mixed bag. i am enjoying england 's creativity and their ability to fashion try-scoring opportunities , even if they must be more clinical in accepting them .. their first try summed up what is best about this england side .. george ford is a sublime late passer of the ball and when he works in conjunction with a talent such as jonathan joseph , who has quick feet , pace and strength , it can prove lethal .. the caveat is that scotland were poor and most top international defences are akin to that which england encountered in dublin , the only six nations game this season when the england backs have been blunted .. george ford is a sublime late passer of the ball and clearly has the composure for test matches. jonathan joseph has such quick feet and that is an attribute that can be lethal when linked with ford. ford and ben youngs are now established as starters and an established half-back pairing is a boon to any side .. equally , i believe the back three of mike brown , jack nowell and anthony watson are probably the preferred trio going forward and joseph is a must at outside centre with the cutting edge he now brings -- four tries in four six nations games this season .. a settled side will allow those chances to be created but , more importantly , finished off .. ben youngs ( right ) is part of an established half-back pairing with ford and that is a boon to any side. northampton lock courtney lawes is one of the key men for england , with an athleticism that matches anything in the southern hemisphere .. he is capable of big plays and hits beyond the ability of others in the pack .. he will go up another gear against france on saturday .. add joe launchbury to the mix and england have arguably the best second-row pairing in world rugby .. courtney lawes is a key man for england and his athleticism matches anything in the southern hemisphere. the southern hemisphere teams , and indeed ireland and wales , wo n't be particularly bothered whether england win the title or not -- only grand slams impress the rugby world at large -- but england winning the title could be important .. they have won nothing under stuart lancaster -- england have won only one title since 2003 -- so to chalk up a championship would be a useful stepping stone and receiving the trophy at twickenham would help set up the year ahead .. that defeat in dublin would be my abiding memory of this championship , though .. england have won nothing under stuart lancaster so a championship would be a useful stepping stone. i have studiously avoided mentioning england 's injured players in this tournament because if they are unavailable they simply do n't come into the equation , but moving into the world cup forwards alex corbisiero , launchbury and , hopefully , tom croft will add considerably to this side 's firepower .. england still have n't got this entirely right , as they showed against ireland , but against the scots on saturday tom youngs and geoff parling , in particular , made a big impact that was n't quite reflected on the scoreboard .. there are international players and there are the top international players who can go head to head with the all blacks and south africans -- we need the bench full of top players .. with england 's policy of using the bench they will be there in the final 20 minutes where the big games are won and lost .. tom youngs made a big impact that maybe was n't reflected on the scoreboard , he is a good bench option. i am really warming to jack nowell , who has returned to the international scene a much better and stronger player than when first blooded last season .. he 's industrious and has all-round rugby nous .. against scotland the ball came to him frequently , which is a good sign in a winger .. the exeter chiefs man could really kick on now .. jack nowell scores for england against scotland , he has returned to the international scene a stronger player. video o2 inside line : england v scotland match review. we 've been here before !. luther burrell has good qualities but has no kicking game and looked on edge yesterday .. england need a better ` footballing ' 12 and might have owen farrell in mind , but he has endured an injury-hit 12 months and does he fit into the dynamic of england 's back line ?. you would think manu tuilagi must play some role but is he similar to burrell ?. if not , where do you play him and who do you drop ?. henry slade could well be a strong contender but england have been reluctant to blood him , which is a badly missed opportunity .. luther burrell has good qualities but no kicking game , england need a better ` fooballing ' 12 in the side. ford clearly has composure at test level but others do not -- so much so that gilt-edged opportunities went begging against scotland .. the excitement and/or pressure of test rugby is causing mistakes .. experience will help considerably but also highly pressurised coaching will help too .. ford has the composure required for test level but the scotland game showed that others do not. it is too late now to integrate danny cipriani and steffon armitage into your starting team .. ford is my first-choice 10 but i would have started cipriani against the scots as we had to see him in a competitive match .. england can not start either against france now and that 's the only match that matters before the world cup , the only real test .. we have seriously missed the boat with these two .. i would have started danny cipriani against the scots as we had to see him in a competitive match. there were 13 penalties against ireland and 10 against the scots , which is still too high .. and it 's when they occur that is important , too .. england are conceding too many penalties when either in no immediate danger from opponents or needlessly when on the attack -- for instance , joe marler going in on the angle in the first half when england had the scotland scrum on toast and it was odds on for a pushover try .. in the second half dan cole was very lucky not to get a yellow card for diving in .. on another day it could cost you the world cup .. england are conceding too many penalties needlessly such as jose marler ( centre ) going in on the angle. the england line-out has been strong but it must be better , the very best in the world .. england must continue to chase line-out perfection , to drill those routines until they ca n't go wrong .. the scrum , one of the key weapons , has at best been 50-50 in the last two tests .. we must get it back to its best for what is to come .. the england line-out has been strong but it must be better , the very best in the world , reaching perfection. ford is good but he is not a world-class kicker yet at test level , and he missed two shots again on saturday .. england need to address this .. ford is still developing and can improve his percentages , but they need alternatives .. in my opinion , farrell is their best goal-kicker so how is that factored into team selection ?. the standard is leigh halfpenny .. drop goals just do not seem to register with england .. just study the history of the world cup to understand why they matter , especially in the big games .. leigh halfpenny is the standard in terms of world-class kickers , ford is good but not at that level yet. fortress twickenham : england 's magnificent home ground still is n't the citadel it needs to be for the world cup .. it is a home and not a fortress .. the crowd must raise their game against france .. a championship will be at stake and england fans need to show just how badly that matters to them .. it does make a difference -- we have home advantage and this could still be the key to england success .. going in to the final weekend of the six nations , four teams - england , ireland , wales and france - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy .. here 's how each can be victorious .. england 's home ground still is n't the citadel it needs to be for the world cup , it is a home and not a fortress

'. mr wagner says to his little girl , which translates to ` hey my beauty ' in french .. he then moves to side of phuoc 's bed and kisses her on the head and asks how she fells in french , as the two share a tender father-daughter moment .. mrs wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well , and updated supporters on her husband and daughter 's recovery , as well as their continued search to find a donor for binh .. ` so hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark : it seems like a blur , ' mrs wagner wrote on facebook .. ` michael still in hospital , phuoc still on morphine , and mommy holding on on coffee .. still a fair amount of discomfort for michael but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row .

'. despite the health problems , mrs wagner does not regret her decision .. she said : ` we look back and we have no regrets .. ` we would travel this path all over again .. they have taught us openness , they have taught our children sharing and openness .. it 's been nothing but a wonderful mess .

convicted bali nine drug smuggler andrew chan who turned to god after being handed a death sentence in indonesia has been ordained as a christian minister .. after six long years of study inside bali 's kerobokan jail , the 31-year-old was ordained inside the prison 's chapel last month as he found out his and myuran sukumaran 's plea for clemency from indonesian president joko widodo had been rejected again .. the sydney man was ordained by christie buckingham , a senior pastor with the bayside church in melbourne , who bought with her a letter of accreditation approving chan as a christian minister in australia .. convicted bali nine drug smuggler andrew chan ( left ) , seen here with matius arif mirdjaja who he baptised , has now been ordained as a christian minsiter. five senior ministers from different denominations endorsed chan after he spent years studying the religion and helping drug addicts within the prison .. reverend buckingham told the sydney morning herald : ' i have never experienced a student like andrew , and probably never will again .. he has such a determination to learn , in fact almost a desperation . '. ` he is the real deal , and myuran [ sukumaran ] is as well .. they are living proof that people can change , circumstances can change .. indonesia should be proud of the impact they are having , ' she added .. sukumaran and chan await transfer from kerobokan prison to the death island of nusakambangan , where they are set to face the firing squad. sukumaran ( left ) and chan ( right ) are both said to be changed men since they were arrested in 2015 on heroin smuggling charges. reverend buckingham first met the pair in 2011 after her friend founded indonesian charity group yayasan tangan kasih ( arms of love ) which works in kerobokan prison .. in february , a former inmate of kerobokan prison told daily mail australia how he was baptised by the bali nine member .. he said chan helped him kick his 20-year drug addiction , and called on the indonesian government to show the australian mercy .. when matius arif mirdjaja first spoke to andrew chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs .. the pair knew of each other from the previous three times mirdjaja had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken .. after mirdjaja was baptised , he and chan ( second left ) started up a bible study group inside kerobokan prison. it was not until mirdjaja ( pictured ) personally witnessed chan 's devotion to god that he started to believe in christianity. in 2011 , the indonesian - who is now 40 years old - was imprisoned for robbery . '. [ the first time we spoke ] we had a debate about philosophy and christianity , ' mirdjaja told daily mail australia .. ` at that time , i mocked him because i said that ` the christian foundation is a really silly thing to believe .. how do you as a christian believe in someone who died on the cross and could n't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass ? ". mirdjaja said chan did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled at him .. after the first conversation , they continued their debates about religion , philosophy and history , which the australian ` knows a lot about ' .. this photo taken in 2006 shows enforcer , myuran sukumaran ( left ) and mastermind andrew chan in a holding cell at denpasar court. chan and sukumaran admitted their roles in the bali nine drug ring as part of a appeal against their death sentences. myuran sukumaran ( left ) has been awarded his associate degree in fine arts , a cause for joy in his darkest days on death row. ` one day he came to me and said ` you ca n't fit god in your brain man , no matter how big your brain is , you can not fit god in your brain because god is in your heart , so you have to fit god in your heart ' , ' mirdjaja said .. ` he said that to me ... at that time i had addiction to drugs inside prison still [ to heroin ] .. ` during that period , he gave me a bible but i just threw it away and again andrew never got offended .

'. i had my addiction for 20 years and that 's when i stopped and i realised that he taught me a lot about christianity .. i made the decision to be baptised in prison , so andrew baptised me . '. after mirdjaja was baptised , he and chan started up a bible study group inside kerobokan prison .. according to the indonesian , this is one of many programs chan and his fellow bali nine inmate , myuran sukuraman , have pioneered to help rehabilitate ` hundreds ' of prisoners .. mirdjaja left prison in 2013 and has now started to preach at churches in south-east asia , while trying to roll out rehabilitation programs started by the australians to help others at 17 different prisons around indonesia .. mirdjaja visits chan five times a week when he 's in bali .. mirdjaja said he had witnessed chan and sukuraman change people 's lives in prison and they deserved to be spared .. ` these guys have love and compassion and a genuine heart .. my life before i had seen so many lies , i 've seen all the people speak the other way around with their behaviour , ' he said .. ` they do a good thing in their right hand but bad thing in their left hand ..

government cuts after the next election will be even deeper than previously announced -- but will come to an end earlier than planned , treasury figures revealed today .. george osborne said he needed to slash a further # 30billion from government spending by 2017/18 , with # 12billion of savings coming from the welfare budget .. the government 's spending watchdog said the planned cuts would be deeper than ` anything seen over the past five years ' .. but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade in 2019/20 .. george osborne 's planned cuts will be deeper than ` anything seen over the past five years ' .. but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade. government spending as a percentage of gdp will no longer fall to the lowest level since the 1930s , after mr osborne dropped plans to run a # 23billion surplus in 2019/20. the office for budget responsibility said the plans amounted to a ` rollercoaster ' of public spending .. mr osborne 's proposal to end austerity a year earlier than expected appeared to be designed to blunt labour 's claim that state spending will shrink to a level not seen since the 1930s .. but delivering his budget today , the chancellor said new plans would mean state spending as a share of national income the same size as britain had in 2000 - when labour was in office - but before , mr osborne said , ` spending got out of control ' .. the chancellor used his speech to trumpet official forecasts showing better economic growth .. borrowing will also be # 5billion less than expected over the next three years , he said .. mr osborne said official predictions also saw the national debt starting to fall earlier than had previously been thought .. national debt as a proportion of gdp will start to fall next year , not 2016/17 as previously thought .. under george osborne 's plans , government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp to a level last seen in 2000 under tony blair. the government is still spending # 90 billion more than it raises in taxes -- and this will only be wiped out by 2018/19 .. for 2015/16 , the deficit will be cut to # 75.3 billion in 2015/16 and then # 39.4 billion the following year .. in 2017/18 it will fall to # 12.8 billion before moving into a surplus of # 5.2 billion the year after .. but in 2019/20 , the planned surplus will only rise to # 7billion instead of the previously planned # 23.1 billion .. meanwhile , debt as a proportion of gdp is expected to fall in the next fiscal year to 80.2 per cent .. he said : ` this is a budget that takes britain one more big step on the road from austerity to prosperity .. ` because the national debt share is falling a year earlier than forecast at the autumn statement , the squeeze on public spending ends a year earlier too .. ` in the final year of this decade , 2019-20 , public spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy .. we can do that while still running a healthy surplus to bear down on our debt .

emma easterby , 34 , says she no longer takes daughter alexis to sure start centre , darlington , after she was told to take her buggy outside. council bosses have come under fire after barring parents from bringing their prams into a mother and baby centre for ` health and safety reasons ' , telling them to use an outside buggy park instead .. the angry parents say staff at the sure start centre in darlington are forcing them to leave expensive prams chained up in freezing weather , and fear they could become a target for thieves .. it is thought the buggy park has been in place for around three weeks , despite previous government advice saying there is no need for a ` blanket ban ' on prams inside children 's centres .. mother emma easterby , 34 , says the ban means she no longer fells comfortable taking her four-month-old daughter alexis to the centre .. she said : ` it 's health and safety gone mad .. my baby has underdeveloped eyesight and doctors told me to use the sensory room there but i ca n't now as i ca n't take her pram in .. ` there is no way i 'm going to leave the pram chained up outside , i could n't afford to replace it if it was stolen and i do n't want to put my baby into a freezing cold buggy when we come back out .. ` if word gets out that we are leaving our prams outside then we could be targeted .. ` the staff have been abrupt and say it 's health and safety but that never stopped us before - i 've been going there for three months , the prams were n't causing problems or blocking corridors . '. i was there one friday with no problem at all and by the same monday we were turned away at the door .. there was no warning given at all . '. after refusing to leave her pram unattended , natalie henderson , 28 , claims she was told to take her baby to another centre to be weighed .. she said : ' i went to the centre twice a week until they told me to leave my pram outside .. ` i 'm not putting my baby into a freezing cold pram - it needs sorting , i ca n't get my baby weighed .. ` they say it 's health and safety but that 's rubbish , it 's supposed to be a centre for babies and children and they could get sick as a result of this nonsense . '. darlington council said the ban on taking prams inside the centre ( pictured ) was made after staff carried out a risk assessment and found they were blocking walkways and fire exits. jade davidson , who is mum to four-month-old charlie , added : ` it was about three weeks ago when i first encountered the ban .. i could n't believe what i was hearing i thought it was a joke .. ` charlie has not been very well since birth so when i was asked to leave his pram outside in the sleet and rain i was really upset . '. i needed to take him in to be weighed so i agreed but when i came back out and put him in the buggy he was freezing and developed a cold as a result . '. i understand that the ban wo n't be such a big deal in summer and i went back last week and explained that i could n't leave my buggy inside again .. ` they let me bring the pram inside that day because it was a quiet time but it 's not really good enough . '. a spokesman for darlington borough council said that the ban was put in place after staff carried out a risk assessment and found the prams were blocking walkways and fire exits .. she added that the centre has recently become busier as a result of new courses being put on , and was struggling to fit the extra pushchairs inside .. the government 's health and safety executive responded to similar cases by saying : ` there is no health and safety reason for a blanket ban on buggies and prams in a children 's centre .. ms easterby , who takes her daughter to use the sensory room at the centre after she was born with underdeveloped eyesight , says she fears the pram park could become a target for thieves. ` seeking a solution that works for everyone would be infinitely preferable to hiding behind quoting " health and safety " as a blanket excuse . '. darlington 's mp jenny chapman said : ` only a crazy person would insist parents wake their sleeping children before they 're ready .. ` i 'm sure there were sound practical reasons for suggesting the rule but we need to make sure nothing puts parents off accessing services . '. jenni cooke , a councillor responsbile for children , families and learning , added : ` we have n't banned people from bringing prams and buggies into the centre but it is a question of safety for everyone who uses it .. ` we 've asked people to use their judgement , particularly at busy times , and park their prams and buggies in the covered , on-site buggy park .. ` we will provide locks and help people get in and out of the centre if they need help .

a top department of homeland security official improperly used his influence to help tony rodham -- hillary clinton 's youngest brother -- with visas for his company 's foreign investors , according to a new inspector general report .. investigators said alejandro mayorkas helped efforts to secure the visas in ways that created the appearance of favoritism and special access .. he also helped virginia gov. terry mcauliffe 's green-car venture in ` unprecedented ' fashion , according to the inspector general , and a casino company whose success was a pet project of then-senate majority leader harry reid .. mayorkas was at the time in charge of u.s. citizenship and immigration services .. mrs. clinton 's latest ` brother eruption ' could complicate her quest for the white house .. hillary clinton 's brother , tony rodham ( left ) benefited from the improper influence of a top homeland security official who intervened to help his clients get special visas for their overseas investors , according to a new inspector general report. alejandro mayorkas , now the no. 2 official at homeland security , headed u.s. citizenship and immigration services when rodham approached him for ` unprecedented ' help. ` brother eruption ' : hillary 's older brother hugh ( right ) made unwelcome news at the end of president bill clinton 's tenure by successfully lobbying him to commute the federal drug-dealing prison sentence of a democratic party donor 's son .. trouble : hillary rodham clinton is poised for a presidential run and her brothers ' histories could come back to haunt her. when she was first lady , a series of embarrassing episodes including both tony and hugh rodham led white house staffers to refer to them with an eye-roll as ` the brothers rodham . '. hillary 's older brother hugh made unwelcome news at the end of president bill clinton 's tenure by successfully lobbying him to commute the federal drug-dealing prison sentence of a democratic party donor 's son .. hugh had been paid $ 400,000 by the donor to lobby for that outcome .. he later returned the money as a scandal grew .. at the time , mayorkas -- already a rodham friend -- intervened and spoke to the white house about the request , something he conceded during his 2009 senate confirmation hearing was a mistake .. hillary , then a freshman u.s. senator from new york , distanced herself from her brother in a press conference . '. i did not know my brother was involved in any way in any of this , ' she said at the time . '. i did not have any involvement in the pardons that were granted or not granted , and i 'm just very disappointed about my brother 's involvement . '. separately , tony rodham had his own brush with presidential pardon embarrassment , successfully pressing president clinton to pardon a tennessee couple convicted of bank fraud .. clinton overruled objections from the justice department in granting that request .. tony rodham claimed he received no money in exchange for his access to the oval office , but the house oversight and government reform committee later found that he was paid as a consultant .. more recently , a book due out in may describes a scheme involving an alleged sweetheart deal tony rodham benefited from in haiti .. he was a board member of a north carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by bill clinton .. that work was conducted through the clinton foundation , a philanthropy that now bears hillary 's name .. virginia 's democratic governor terry mcauliffe ( right ) , shown with prince charles and carol cadou , senior vice president for historic preservation at mount vernon , got special favors for his green-technology firm. the latest rodham embarrassment , revealed tuesday , involves influential democrats who sought help from tony with securing visas as part of a complicated foreign investor program .. the u.s. government 's investor-visa program , known as eb-5 , allows foreigners to obtain visas to live permanently in the u.s. with their spouses and children if they invest $ 500,000 to $ 1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for american citizens .. jeh johnson , u.s. secretary of homeland security , said mayorkas is ` exceptionally conscientious , honest and patriotic ' -- despite his link to the latest scandal. approved investors can become legal permanent residents after two years and later can become u.s. citizens .. tony rodham ran gulf coast funds management , a firm that specialized in recruiting foreign investors and securing their eb-5 visas .. greentech automotive , run by now-virginia gov. terry mcauliffe -- who was bill clinton 's top fundraiser in the 1990s -- contracted with gulf coast .. homeland security inspector general john roth wrote that he did n't know why mayorkas intervened in the cases , and did n't accuse him of violating any laws .. but he criticized the long-time democratic legal eagle for using his influence improperly .. roth also praised as ` courageous ' the agency employees who confidentially had complained about mayorkas ' actions and promised they would be protected as whistleblowers .. mayorkas said in a statement that he disagreed with roth 's findings but added that ' i will certainly learn from it and from this process . '. he added : ` there was erroneous decision-making and insufficient security vetting of cases .. i could not and did not turn my back on my responsibility to address those grave problems .. i made improving the program a priority and i did so in a hands-on manner . '. the chairman of the house homeland security committee , texas republican rep. michael mccaul , said the findings were ` extremely concerning ' and that he will conduct a congressional hearing about them thursday .. roth was expected to testify .. hillary clinton 's brothers hugh rodham ( left ) and tony rodham ( right ) have been intermittent sources of embarrassment since her days ad first lady during the 1990s. sls las vegas , a casino that opened late last year , benefited from undue influence in securing foreign investors with the promise of visas that could lead to us citizenship. the white house praised mayorkas on wednesday when asked about the brewing scandal , saying he still works at dhs ` because he is a decorated public servant and an effective leader of that organization . '. press secretary josh earnest said the president and his advisers ` certainly value the kind of contribution that he has made to the effective management of that department , and he has played an important role in implementing needed reforms in that department . '. in fact , earnest told fox news ' ed henry , mayorkas is ` leading the effort ' to implement reforms in the department in question and ` strengthen ' the eb-5 program .. after henry expressed shock at white house 's full-throated support in the homeland security official who ` basically gave special visas and access to politically-connected democrats , ' earnest said , ` to be clear , ed , the inspector general , who , as you point out , did take a close and independent look at this , did not suggest that these individuals were n't deserving of a visa . '. ` what he suggested is merely that the process did n't work very well , ' obama 's spokesman said .. ` these are exactly the problems that deputy secretary mayorkas was trying to address , and there are additional reforms that are needed , and there will be additional reforms that are implemented . '. refusing to let earnest off the hook , henry asked if mayorkas was trying to make reforms when he let hillary clinton 's brother ` jump to the front of the line . '. ` that 's not the accusation , ed , ' the white house spokesman fired back .. ` go back to the inspector general report - that is not what it said , ' a visibly agitated earnest told him .. the inspector general 's new conclusions also cast doubt on whether the homeland security department withheld embarrassing internal files the ap had sought under the u.s. freedom of information act as part of its own investigation nearly two years ago -- and instead released records that indicated no wrongdoing .. the ap in july 2013 requested all emails to or from mayorkas over the preceding seven months that contained specific words or names , including rodham .. the government eventually sent ap more than 200 pages , mostly censored , including emails in which mayorkas told investors and agency staff that he would not become involved in internal deliberations . '. i can not weigh in , ' mayorkas wrote to assistant secretary douglas smith on feb. 1 , 2013 , in a message turned over to the ap and cited in the new inspector general 's report .. ` the ( investor 's ) attorney sent an email to me and i responded that i could not weigh in . '. but the inspector general 's report also cited other messages from mayorkas that were never turned over to the associated press .. in one case , mayorkas forwarded a january 2013 email from rodham about delays with a high importance designation .. the email would have been covered under ap 's information request since mayorkas sent it during the relevant time period and contained rodham 's name .. ` staff understood these applications were getting high-level attention , ' the inspector general 's report said .. virginia gov. terry mcauliffe , another democrat , was also connected to the investor proposal but later divested .. his spokesman , brian coy , said the report demonstrated that mcauliffe asked the government to decide on the investment proposal in a timely fashion .. the other two cases involved a hollywood investment program and an investment effort in nevada that had ties to former pennsylvania gov. ed rendell and senate democratic leader harry reid of nevada , respectively .. the reid-related project was sls , a casino project that he did n't invest in but advocated strongly for as nevada 's senior senator .. homeland security secretary jeh johnson said there were lessons to be learned in the inspector general 's investigation but described mayorkas in a statement as ` exceptionally conscientious , honest and patriotic . '. ` he is often impatient with our sluggish government bureaucracy , can at times be very hands-on in resolving issues and problems that are brought to his personal attention , and is always mindful that we are public servants , ' johnson said .. ` ali works hard to do the right thing , and never acts , in my observation , for reasons of personal advancement or aggrandizement .

an audacious raid on two armoured trucks on a busy motorway was last night being linked to a notorious gang known as the pink panthers .. jewels worth at least # 7million were stolen by armed robbers who struck yesterday at a toll booth on the route linking paris to the south of france .. the daring raid took place just after midnight as the security trucks approached the toll at avallon in burgundy , 125 miles south-east of paris on the a6 .. burnt-out vehicles are seen after a group of battle-hardened armed thieves attacked two heavily guarded vans carrying jewels. authorities are combing the yonne region in burgundy southeast of paris and surrounding areas for the attackers ( file picture ). the robbery took place on the a6 highway connecting paris and lyon. the a6 is a major route connecting the north and south of the country. as they slowed for the barrier , four cars forced them to a halt and up to 15 robbers appeared wearing balaclavas and brandishing automatic weapons .. they used gas sprays to knock out the two armed guards in each lorry .. the guards were pulled from their cabs and dumped by the toll booth .. yesterday 's raid bore all the hallmarks of having been carried out by the pink panthers , a gang responsible for audacious heists across europe and beyond over the past two decades .. they always wear balaclavas or face masks and use kalashnikovs and high-powered stolen cars to carry out their spectacular crimes .. the pink panthers are said to speak several languages and travel on genuine passports issued to other people , but with the photos changed .. many are former soldiers from eastern europe .. france is their favoured operating ground but they have carried out more than 100 heists across the globe , netting # 300million .. cities where they have struck include london , dubai , geneva , monte carlo and tokyo .. in 2008 a court in chambery , south-eastern france , found three serb members of the pink panthers guilty of carrying out robberies in biarritz , cannes , courchevel and saint-tropez .. no shots were fired and the robbers drove off in the security trucks , which belonged to a paris company and were full of jewels and other valuables .. other gang members escaped in the cars .. prosecutors said much of the raid would have been caught on cctv .. the trucks were found burned out -- and empty -- four hours later , 20 miles north in a wood in the village of quenne , just off the a6 near auxerre .. a mechanical digger was discovered with its arm inside one truck , suggesting that the safes on board were transferred to the get-away cars .. there were reports that the cars were spotted speeding towards paris .. police helicopters and other units were scrambled to hunt the gang but by dawn there was no sign .. the security guards are being held for questioning .. the a6 , known as the ` motorway of the sun ' is hugely popular with holidaymakers , and is used by hundreds of thousands of british drivers every year .. the methods used in the robbery immediately led to speculation that the pink panthers -- a notorious gang of criminals from eastern europe -- had struck again .. the gang earned their name in 1993 after stealing a # 500,000 diamond from a jewellers in mayfair , london , and hiding it in a jar of face cream -- a tactic copied from the 1963 film the pink panther , starring peter sellers as the bungling inspector clouseau .. the film 's title refers to the name of the missing diamond , although a cartoon pink panther appears in the opening and closing credits .. the police official says no one was injured in the attack early wednesday , and the drivers of the two vans were left at the scene unharmed ( file picture )
a florida mom is accused of leaving her three children alone in her bedroom so she could go drinking at a bar on saturday afternoon .. according to a flagler county sheriff 's office deputies , that act almost led to her one-year-old baby choking to death on a smoked cigarette after the child got a butt from a full ashtray in the bedroom .. in addition to leaving her one-year-old baby , kendra hampton , 39 , is also accused of leaving her two-year-old and nine-year-old children at her palm coast home .. arrested : kendra hampton is accused of leaving her three children alone in a bedroom so she could go drinking. the woman 's boyfriend said hampton began drinking at 1pm on saturday and that she had been ` drinking alcohol excessively for the past few months ' , news 13 reported .. after he vacated the house and left her with the three kids , hampton decided she ` needed a break ' and headed to the bar .. two adults who were home at the time said they did n't know hampton had left the children alone .. one of them heard the baby choking and was able to pry the butt out of its mouth .. when she returned , hampton and her boyfriend got in a fight .. she was charged with felony child neglect , domestic violence and resisting arrest without violence. she allegedly punched him in the nose , but he was not seriously hurt , wesh reported .. someone at the home called 911 and police said hampton was combative when they arrived .. she was charged with three counts of felony child neglect , domestic violence and resisting arrest without violence .. hampton was taken to the flagler county inmate facility and was being held on a $ 5,550 bond .
george osborne today handed a # 3,000 boost to first time buyers to make it easier to get on the housing ladder .. in his final budget before the general election , the chancellor announced a new ` help-to-buy isa ' only available to those yet to buy their first home .. the new savings account will see the government add # 50 to every # 200 which savers manage to put away towards a deposit .. it will mean that anyone who saves # 12,000 towards a deposit will have it topped up by # 3,000 .. but critics said it will still take first-time buyers five years to save the cash by which time house prices will have soared by another # 15,000 .. the new savings account will see the government add # 50 to every # 200 savers manage to put away towards a deposit. matt hutchinson , director of the house share website spareroom , welcomed mr osborne 's announcement - but said it might still not be enough .. he said : ` at first glance , a handout of up to # 3,000 from the government for hopeful first time buyers looks too good to be true .. ` but to get your maximum # 3,000 bonus , with maximum monthly payments of just # 200 , you 'll be saving for four and a half long years .. by which time , prices will likely have risen again and a # 15,000 deposit wo n't be enough . '. the accounts will only be available for the next four years , but once they have been opened there will be no limit on how long people can save for .. they will be available through banks and building societies this autumn , with first time buyers able to make an initial deposit of # 1,000 when they open the account .. there will be no minimum monthly deposit -- but people will only be able to save up to # 200 a month .. the government has also capped the total bonus they will pay at # 3,000 .. the chancellor said the soaring size of deposits was making it harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. according to treasury documents released today , people outside london now need almost # 30,000 for a deposit on their first home , while in london they need almost # 70,000. first-time buyers in london will be allowed to use the bonus to buy homes worth up to # 450,000 - but for everyone else the ceiling will be # 250,000 .. unveiling the new savings accounts in the house of commons this afternoon , mr osborne said they were needed because of the growing size of deposits .. according to treasury documents released today , first-time buyers in london now need almost # 70,000 to get their first home .. outside london people need almost # 30,000 .. soaring house prices and tighter mortgage rules have made it harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder. mr osborne told mps : ` the help to buy isa for first time buyers works like this .. for every # 200 you save for your deposit , the government will top it up with # 50 more .. it 's as simple as this -- we 'll work hand in hand to help you buy your first home .. this is a budget that works for you . '. a 10 per cent deposit on the average first home costs # 15,000 , so if you put in up to # 12,000 -- we 'll put in up to # 3,000 more . '. a 25 per cent top-up is equivalent to saving for a deposit from your pre-tax income -- it 's effectively a tax cut for first time buyers .. we 'll work with industry so it 's ready for this autumn and we 'll make sure you can start saving for it right now . '. the new accounts will be limited to only one person rather than one home -- meaning couples can receive a double bonus .. but the small print of the scheme reveals that people will not be able to use the bonus to buy properties abroad .. the new isas were part of a raft of measures to help people 's savings go further .. the chancellor said new rules would be introduced to stop people paying any interest on their savings .. people will be able to make # 1,000 of interest on their savings before any tax is applied .. the move will take 95 per cent of people out of savings taxes .. workers will also be able to earn # 11,000 before paying income tax at all .
when the first astronauts land on mars , they will not use a conventional parachute or heat shield that has been used before .. instead , upon impacting the upper martian atmosphere , a large inflatable saucer-shaped structure will slow their progress .. this is the low density supersonic decelerator ( ldsd ) and , in june , nasa will perform the latest test of this groundbreaking technology - a vital next step in the journey to mars .. scroll down for a video from last year 's test. in june , the vehicle will be sent into near-space from the navy 's pacific missile range facility on kauai , hawaii , to test its re-entry capabilities into earth 's atmosphere. tomorrow at 9am to 10am pdt ( 5pm to 6pm gmt ) , nasa will perform a spin test of the vehicle at the jet propulsion laboratory in california before transporting it to hawaii .. the event will be streamed live on ustream , and viewers will be able to ask questions on twitter using the #asknasa hashtag .. ultimately , the vehicle will be sent into near-space from the navy 's pacific missile range facility on kauai , hawaii , in june .. the ldsd is unique in its design , using a donut-shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag .. when attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at mach 3.5 it will be capable of slowing it down to mach 2 , where a regular parachute can then deploy .. last june , to simulate the martian atmosphere on earth , the ldsd was lifted to a height of 23 miles ( 37km ) by a high-altitude balloon .. a small rocket then launched it 11 miles ( 18km ) higher .. as this point the ldsd inflated around a larger saucer-shaped object , bringing it safely back to land in open water .. ` the ldsd crosscutting demonstration mission will test breakthrough technologies that will enable large payloads to be safely landed on the surface of mars , or other planetary bodies with atmospheres , including earth , ' nasa said in a statement .. ` the technologies will not only enable landing of larger payloads on mars , but also allow access to much more of the planet 's surface by enabling landings at higher-altitude sites . '. esessentially parachute , the ldsd is large - 15ft ( 4.6 metres ) wide and weighing 7,000 lbs ( 3.200 kg ) - in order to cope with the atmosphere of mars .. earth has a reasonably thick atmosphere , so we can parachute relatively easily to the surface .. but the martian atmosphere is much thinner , so parachutes need to be much larger in order to create sufficient drag to land safely .. the system is designed to land large vehicles on the surface of mars .. the main structural body of the second flight test vehicle in nasa 's ldsd project is seen during its assembly in a cleanroom at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory.the flight test for this vehicle is planned in june of this year .. it will eventually be used to take humans to the surface of mars. a successful test took place in june 2014 , shown , when the ldsd successfully re-entered part of earth 's atmosphere .. it showed that while some aspects of the vehicle worked , others - like its parachutes - needed further development following the test. the curiosity rover , for example , needed an innovative landing method due to its size but this technology was n't ready yet .. instead , to land the rover on the surface nasa developed a landing mechanism that used rockets known as the ` sky crane ' .. the ldsd , however , is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than curiosity , such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves .. there will be four tests of the ldsd in total before mission managers decide whether to employ it on future mars missions .. the tests are taking place over the hawaiian island of kauai in june .. in a test last year , in june 2014 , the vehicle was partially successful - although a parachute was torn apart when it deployed , owing to the high forces .. moment of truth : the parachute is shown here unfurling on the right .. the balloon on the left was used to pull the 200lb ( 90kg ) parachute from its sturdy canister. the ldsd , shown , is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than curiosity , such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves. carried as payload during the shakeout flight were two technologies scheduled to be tested next year aboard this same type of test vehicle .. the supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator ( siad ) is a large , doughnut-shaped air brake that deployed during the flight , helping slow the vehicle from 3.8 to two times the speed of sound .. the second , the supersonic disksail parachute , is the largest supersonic parachute ever flown .. it has more than double the area of the parachute which was used for the mars science laboratory mission that carried the curiosity rover to the surface of mars . '. a good test is one where there are no surprises but a great test is one where you are able to learn new things , and that is certainly what we have in this case , ' said ian clark , principal investigator for ldsd at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory , after the test .. and nasa will be hoping to learn just as much on their latest attempt at using the ldsd .
a simple wooden bottle that can ` age ' cheap booze in less than a day , could make humble plonk taste like vintage wine , inventors claim .. while expensive vintages develop their flavour over years in oak barrels , the makers of the oak bottle promise their gadget will replicate the ageing process in just 24 hours .. it means drinks lovers could enjoy the oaky flavours of premium tipples without having to fork out the high prices they demand .. the oak bottle can turn cheap booze into fine wine with a vintage oak taste , its makers claim. all users need to do is pour their favourite wines in the bottle , which is made of sustainably sourced american oak , and then leave it for up to two days to take on the flavour of the receptacle .. the bottle , which costs $ 79.99 ( # 50 ) from oakbottle.com , can also be used to improve the flavours of brandies , bourbons and even tequila .. it 's the brainchild of canadian entrepreneur joel paglione , who came up with the idea after growing up on his parent 's vineyard .. mr paglione , 30 , who now lives in chicago , spent three years developing the oak bottle , which he says is the world 's smallest and fastest way to infuse drinks with oak .. eight other versions which are flavoured with the likes of cherry , vanilla , maple and coffee are also available .. he said : ` the oak bottle is a revolutionary device that makes cheap wine or spirits taste like an expensive vintage in just 24 to 48 hours .. the oak bottle can also mellow the flavour of whisky , brandy and even tequila. ` what took months or years in oak barrels before takes just days now with oak bottle .. ` my family has a vineyard and winery in canada so i grew up in the wine making industry .. ` once i was old enough to help , i asked why we spend so much time filling small barrels of wine for oak ageing versus pouring it all into a giant barrel like we do the fermentation tanks .. ` the answer , my father told me , was the smaller the oak barrel we use the faster the oak infusion and the faster we can achieve the desired oak tannin we are looking for in our wine . '. the best wines spend years ageing in oak barrels. he then spent three years developing the oak bottle , which he claims is the ` smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made ' .. mr paglione explained : ` it 's all about the perfect amount of interaction with oxygen available for the liquid to " breathe " through the wood , and the perfect mount of oak contact of the liquid inside . '. he said the most popular wines for oak bottle ageing are chardonnay , cabernet and merlot .. ` in just 48 hours an unoaked chardonnay will taste like an expensive oaked chardonnay vintage that has been aged in oak barrels for years , ' he claimed .. ` whiskies , bourbons and brandy are also great for ageing with the oak bottle .. he also thinks the bottle is good news for whisky makers as this will speed up the process .. he said : ` allowing people who perhaps could not afford a 20-year aged whiskey or that ten-year old wine vintage the ability to enjoy it but at a fraction of the time and cost .. ` we are not saying that the oak bottle will make a boxed wine into a # 50 bottle , but it can make an average wine much better and less insulting to your taste buds . '. despite just being launched , the oak bottle has already been given the thumbs up by top chefs including american tv personality elizabeth karmel .. miss karmel , the star of us cooking show iron chef , carried out her own independent test of the oak bottle on tequila .. she said : ` it is remarkable how this toasted oak bottle made by coopers has transformed the raw blanco tequila .. ` the proof is in the tasting .. it is layered with complexity - round , sweet and predictably oaky .. i 'd say that the experiment was a success .

westminster 's public administration committee said the country 's top mandarin , sir jeremy heywood ( pictured ) , had been ` wrong in law ' during a row over two of theresa may 's special advisers. sir jeremy heywood was given a humiliating rebuke by mps yesterday for clearing taxpayer-funded advisers to take part in political campaigning .. westminster 's public administration committee said the country 's top mandarin had been ` wrong in law ' during a row over two of theresa may 's special advisers .. it is another blow to the reputation of the cabinet secretary -- who is known as sir cover up for trying to block the publication of letters related to the iraq war .. nick timothy and stephen parkinson , two of the home secretary 's closest aides , refused an order from tory hq to take part in telephone canvassing during last year 's rochester by-election .. the pair said it was a breach of the special adviser 's code , which says that - as public servants - they should not conduct canvassing in by-election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so .. number ten and tory hq disagreed -- suspending both men from the list of candidates at the forthcoming general election as a punishment .. to justify the decision , number ten relied upon advice from sir jeremy , who wields enormous power inside government .. he controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in ` backroom support ' activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category .. but that interpretation has now been flatly rejected by the public administration committee .. the committee said : ` any direction to a special adviser to conduct telephone canvassing was misguided , and that advice that such a direction or such canvassing was permitted under their code and contract of employment was wrong in law .. ` we recommend that special advisers should never again be confronted with directions or informal pressure that puts them in breach of the code and of their contracts of employment . '. the speaker 's counsel , michael carpenter , told mps he had been ` unpersuaded ' by sir jeremy 's arguments .. mr carpenter said that , far from being a backroom activity , telephone canvassing involved taking part in a political debate with members of the public .. mr timothy and mr parkinson are now expected to apply to be re-instated to the candidates list after the election .. sources said they appeared to have a ` slam dunk case ' to get their suspension lifted .. labour deputy chairman jon ashworth said : ` the parliamentary authorities have delivered a damning assessment of the number 10 operation , and we now need to know which ministers were complicit in issuing this ` misguided ' advice .. sir jeremy controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in ` backroom support ' activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category .. ` given the proximity of the election campaign , we need a formal government response today which outlines how number 10 will ensure no rules will be broken over the role played by special advisers . '. at the time , the decision to remove the advisers from the candidates list was widely seen as the latest episode in a long-running feud between downing street and the home office .. tensions have repeatedly flared amid fevered speculation over mrs may 's own leadership ambitions .. polls have shown she is the activists ' favourite to succeed the prime minister .. another of the home secretary 's advisers , fiona cunningham , was forced to quit last summer after clashing with michael gove over extremism in schools .. last week , sir jeremy came under fire over new rules which ban the country 's 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists without ministerial approval .. he approved the order at the request of cabinet office minister francis maude .. yesterday , the mail told how the move was opposed by london mayor boris johnson , who said : ` sunlight is the best disinfectant .

dave bassett believes the tendency of top-flight clubs to employ fashionable foreign managers is holding back the progress of english bosses .. the former wimbledon and sheffield united boss made the comments as sunderland turn to dutchman dick advocaat to turn around the fortunes of the black cats .. just nine english managers are working in the premier league compared to 15 in 1992 and basset believes things have changed for the worse .. sunderland manager dick advocaat issues instructions to his players during the match against west ham. sheffield united manager dave bassett on fa cup semi final day against rivals sheffield wednesday. bassett told the mirror : ` what 's wrong with giving the sunderland job to an english guy ?. there are good foreign managers , but there are more than enough good young managers .. ` it 's just that foreign managers are flavour of the month .. this fashionable idea that foreign managers are better than english ones is a myth .. ` it 's like foreign players .. they move to wherever they can earn the most money .. they are not interested in living the dream for that club .. ` all the nonsense of kissing the badge and they are really only interested in kissing their bank balance .

i just can not understand why ian ritchie has made such a statement .. the first thing that surprises me is the timing , following one of the most exciting days ever in five and six nations history .. england 's victory over france was brilliant to watch , even if they did fall just short of winning the title .. twickenham was rocking and it was an amazing advert for the game ahead of a home world cup .. i 'm in switzerland at present and on the flight the pilot , air stewardesses and all the passengers were talking about saturday and their real optimism for the world cup .. so for ritchie to say finishing second is unacceptable just flattens the mood .. it does n't seem right and is a massive own goal .. stuart lancaster ( second left ) consoles his players after falling six points short of a six nations title. england captain chris robshaw ( left ) and his team-mates came second for the fourth year in succession. ben youngs celebrate his try during england 's storming 55-35 six nations victory against france. more importantly , his words undermine stuart lancaster .. i would go as far as to say he has belittled much of the progress that lancaster and the team have achieved .. if this had happened to me , i would be in ritchie 's office demanding an explanation .. this is professional sport and being a head coach is a tough position .. the moment someone says something , the opposition see a chink , a weakness , and try to drive a wedge through it .. it 's one thing to say these things in private , as professional sport is about winning , but to say them in public is wrong .. if lancaster has called the result unacceptable , fair enough , but ritchie has no qualifications to talk about the team 's performance .. this year is all about preparing for the world cup and england put 55 points and seven tries on the board in style .. the atmosphere at twickenham for england 's final six nations match was electric from start to finish. this was the time for a pat on the back and a united front .. ian ritchie appointed stuart lancaster after an interim period , which was a brave decision when he had the opportunity to put in far more experienced coaches .. he appointed an inexperienced coach in lancaster yet later awarded him a six-year contract .. if the priority was short-term gains , he should have been given a one-year contract .. coming in with no international coaching experience , lancaster has done a very good job .. wales and ireland are very strong teams too so to think you can just win grand slams and championships is very naive and just brings back the tag that the english are arrogant .. ian ritchie ( right ) should be backing lancaster ahead of the eagerly-anticipated world cup in september. i 'm sure ritchie had good intentions , perhaps wanting to be seen to be saying the right thing after another title miss .. but he will regret what he said as england are in a very good position .. if england are going to win the world cup , they have to have everybody together as one team , everybody 's noses pointing in the same direction from the chief executive down to the water boys .. we should all be feeling positive after such a brilliant display against france and looking forward to the world cup .
they say one man 's trash is another man 's treasure and that has certainly proved to be the case for entrepreneur dan cluderay .. while supermarkets regularly throw away food that has gone past its ` best before ' date , mr cluderay , from worksop , nottinghamshire , is now a millionaire after setting up an online business selling out-of-date food to busy mums and bargain hunters .. the 40-year-old says the secret to his success is that his business , approved food , provides just what the savvy shopper is looking for - quality food at prices which save mums around # 60 off their weekly bill compared to a similar shop at one of the big supermarkets .. dan cluderay is enjoying the fruits of his labour after his online business selling out-of-date food proves to be a hit with busy mums. mr cluderay pitching the dragons on the bbc show in may last year ... but his idea was rejected. however , while approved food has been a hit online , it was given a resounding thumbs down by the gurus on the bbc tv show dragons ' den .. in may last year , mr cluderay , together with his 50-year-old business partner andy needham , had asked the dragons ' den panel for a # 150,000 cash injection offering a ten per cent share in approved food .. however , the dragons ' den team , which consisted of duncan bannatyne , kelly hoppen , deborah meaden , piers linney and peter jones , unanimously turned them down .. not to be thwarted , mr cluderay and mr needham managed to source # 400,000 through loans and investments from elsewhere which has seen approved food achieve a # 4million turnover .. ` it 's all very exciting and we have lots of plans to take the business further , ' said father-of-two mr cluderay .. he said his journey to success began when he was forced to have a career rethink after being made redundant from his job at an it firm in 2001 .. andy 's idea did n't excite dragons ' den investors , from left to right , duncan bannatyne , kelly hoppen , deborah meaden , piers linney and peter jones. inside the approved food warehouse which stocks a range of products from toilet roll to dog food. bag a bargain : slim-fast mix available for # .199 and 99p pineapple juice are some of the drinks on offer. together with his wife , nichola , the pair set up market stalls in hull , leeds and doncaster selling branded chocolate , fizzy drinks and crisps which had been shunned by a range of supermarkets as they were either fast approaching or past their ` best before ' date .. for six years , come rain or shine , the couple , who hail from worksop , sourced and sold the goods to a loyal band of shoppers .. however , it was after taking delivery of a crate of twinings nettle tea that mr cluderay said he had his ` eureka moment ' . '. i suddenly realised that while there might not be the demand for nettle tea in doncaster , if i could match the goods with customers looking to buy , i 'd be on to a winner , ' said mr cluderay , who has two sons , nine-year-old rudi and jay , five .. while still working seven days a week on the market stalls , he utilised all his computer skills to start forming a plan to launch his business , approved food .. dan cluderay ( right ) with his partner andy needham at their busy sheffield warehouse. check out : the warehouse in sheffield is dispatching 600 orders a day. mr cluderay also sells household products on his out-of-date goods website '. i was working on my idea wherever i could , ' said mr cluderay .. ` even in my son 's playroom i 'd be beavering away . '. it was on 14 august 2008 , that mr cluderay received his very first order , the day after his website went live .. ` i 'd collected the names and address of 300 people who i thought would be interested in buying products which are perfectly fine but have have just gone past their sell by date , ' he said . '. i was excited sending out the list but even more excited when someone bought something the next day ! '. since then , approved food has gone from strength to strength as thrifty mothers and other savvy shoppers make the most of items such as loo roll , dog food , sweets and sauces .. ` there are only two dates people really need to know about , ' explained mr cluderay .. ` the " best before " date which means that the food will be at its optimum before that date and acts as a guide to the quality , and then there 's the " use by " date which is concerned with the safety aspect .. ` it 's only the " use by " date that means food has to be eaten by then or it could make you ill , which is the case with fish and meat , for example .. ` food is perfectly fine to be eaten way past its " best before " date , as people know , but the large supermarkets wo n't do that and that 's where we come in .. dan reveals how he made his millions by selling out-of-date food on tonight 's bargain fever britain. a twix for 29p and 19p special k crisps are among the deals on the approved food website. busy , busy , busy : the team prepares to pack hundreds of items proving popular with shoppers. ` we sell food , such as cans of baked beans , pasta sauce , tins of tuna , which may have gone past their " best before " date by a few weeks , but everyone knows they will taste just the same as the products which have weeks left to run . '. mr cluderay said they dispatch around 600 orders a day with his average shopper spending around # 40 a week buying cupboard staples such as pasta , pasta sauce , flour and toilet rolls .. ` by comparison , they 'd be spending around # 100 at one of the major supermarkets so they 're actually saving around # 60 which they can then spend on something else .. ` we do n't touch food that has a limited shelf life such as fresh chicken and fresh fish , but we do sell hardy vegetables . '. currently operating from a huge warehouse in sheffield and employing 50 full-time staff , he says he can imagine a time when they have bases around the world . '. i can imagine warehouses in many countries .. the germans in particular are very savvy shoppers and love branded goods , they also love english chocolate , so we get a lot of orders , ' he said .. ` we also sell huge polish chocolate bars , which cost around ten pence each to buy from us which is also extremely popular .. ` our biggest customers are by far and away mothers as they 're the ones usually in charge of the purse strings and are always thinking how to feed their families .. if they 're happy , then so are we . '. mr cluderay and approved food will be featured on the television programme bargain fever britain tonight on itv at 8pm .. the show takes a look at the uk 's insatiable appetite for deals and discounts and will also go behind the scenes at american wholesale giant costco , car supermarket motorpoint and the shoe chain shoe zone .. you will see ` use by ' dates on food that goes off quickly , such as smoked fish , meat products and ready-prepared salads .. do n't use any food or drink after the end of the ` use by ' date on the label , even if it looks and smells fine .. this is because using it after this date could put your health at risk .. for the ` use by ' date to be a valid guide , you must follow storage instructions such as ` keep in a refrigerator ' .. if you do n't follow these instructions , the food will spoil more quickly and you may risk food poisoning .. once a food with a ` use by ' date on it has been opened , you also need to follow any instructions such as ` eat within three days of opening ' .. but remember , if the ` use by ' is tomorrow , then you must use the food by the end of tomorrow , even if the label says ` eat within a week of opening ' and you have only opened the food today .. if a food can be frozen its life can be extended beyond the ` use by ' date .. but make sure you follow any instructions on the pack , such as ` cook from frozen ' or ` defrost thoroughly before use and use within 24 hours ' .. shoppers should make sure they do n't risk their health by eating goods after the end of its use-by date. ` best before ' dates appear on a wide range of frozen , dried , tinned and other foods .. ` best before ' dates are about quality , not safety .. when the date is passed , it does n't mean that the food will be harmful , but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture .. eggs can be eaten after their ` best before ' date as long as they are cooked thoroughly until both yolk and white are solid , or if they are used in dishes where they will be fully cooked such as a cake .. cooking eggs until both the white and yolk are solid will kill any bacteria , such as salmonella .. people who are in ` at-risk ' groups should only eat eggs , or food containing eggs , that have been thoroughly cooked .. these groups include : babies and toddlers ; elderly people ; pregnant women ; people who are already unwell .. every year in the uk we throw away 7.2 m tonnes of food and drink , most of which could have been eaten .. so think carefully before throwing away food past its ` best before ' date .. remember , the ` best before ' date will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the label , such as ` store in a cool dry place ' or ` keep in the fridge once opened ' .. display until / sell by .... date marks such as ` display until ' or ` sell by ' often appear near or next to the ` best before ' or ` use by ' date .. these are instructions for shop staff , not for shoppers .. the important dates for you to look for are the ` use by ' and ` best before ' dates .
a chinese family was kicked off a cathay pacific flight after their three-year-old son refused to wear a seatbelt , causing a delay for other passengers .. the hong kong-bound plane sat at its gate at a bangkok airport for an extra 30 minutes while the family , flight attendants and other travellers were involved in a heated stand-off .. most airlines allow children under two to sit on a parent 's lap during take-off and landing .. any child over that age must sit in their own seat and wear a safety belt .. the boy 's father ( middle ) rowed with other passengers , putting the flight 30 minutes behind schedule. in last thursday 's incident , the boy refused to take his seat and wear a seatbelt moments before flight cx654 was scheduled to take off from suvarnabhumi bangkok international airport , a passenger , named lau , told hong kong 's apple daily newspaper .. all other passengers were seated and prepared for their two-hour journey .. flight attendants asked the family to put the boy in his seat and buckle his safety belt , but the parents refused to obey their directions and insisted that the boy be allowed to sit on his mother 's lap , the south china morning post reported .. a passenger recorded the argument that followed and shared the video with apple daily .. a female passenger urged cabin crew to call police after the family refused to get off the plane. in the video , the boy 's defiant father said : ` if others keep on harassing us , then we will not leave . '. a female passenger , speaking in cantonese , urged cabin crew to call police , adding : ` we are customers too .. why are you two allowed to harass all the passengers on board ?

atlanta ( cnn ) nearly 30 years after the first u.s. stealth bomber took flight , the air force 's aging fleet is primed for a makeover ; albeit an expensive one .. the pentagon is looking to upgrade its stealth aircraft for the first time since the 1970s , developing a high-priority , super-classified , next-generation bomber .. the air force plans to award a contract to build and develop the long range strike bomber to one of the industry 's most powerful firms later this year and hopes to integrate them into the fleet by the mid-2020s .. competing for the prize are northrop grumman , the developer of the air force 's current bomber , the b-2 , and a partnership between aeronautic juggernauts boeing and lockheed martin .. before the house armed services committee earlier this month , william laplante , assistant secretary of the air force for acquisition , suggested the air force will offer a " cost-plus " contract to the winning firm , meaning the government will take on the risk of any cost overrun .. " my belief on the lrs-b ( long range strike bomber ) is it 's going to be more traditional in the sense that we are doing a little bit more cutting edge " development , laplante said .. the air force has said it plans to leverage existing technologies to help keep the lrs-b affordable .. however the center for strategic and budgetary assessments , an independent , nonpartisan research group , warns " near-sighted , build-for-today acquisition strategies may render the issue of ` affordability ' moot , as affordability must also be assessed in the context of a capability 's mission effectiveness over its projected lifespan . ". along with the f-35 joint strike fighter and the kc-46 tanker , the lrs-b is one of the air force 's top modernization priorities , and some experts say its development will go far beyond simply upgrading an aging bomber fleet .. retired air force lt. gen. david deptula told cnn this week that it is inaccurate to label the lrs-b as simply a " bomber " and that officials need to shed the " old think " way of categorizing airplanes into different mission areas .. the new " long range sensor shooter , " as deptula calls it , will have the ability to create a self-forming , self-healing " combat cloud " capable of sharing information with other aircraft and conducting a diverse array of operation types .. pentagon officials have stressed the importance of developing the new long-range strike bomber calling it critical to national security and nuclear deterrence .. it is " absolutely essential for keeping our deterrent edge , " former defense secretary chuck hagel said in january .. " we need to do it .. we need to make the investments .. we 'll have it in the budget . ". deptula said the no. 1 reason to upgrade the long-range sensor force is to counter the constantly evolving threats around the world .. " the chinese , iranians and russians ... have built advanced anti-air systems and long-range fighters , to attack our bases and aircraft carriers , " he said .. adm. william gortney , commander of the north american aerospace defense command , expressed similar security concerns to the senate armed services committee , thursday , telling lawmakers russia is continuing to work on its program to deploy " long-range conventionally armed cruise missiles , " that can be launched from its bomber aircraft , submarines and warships .. officials have been tight-lipped as to the specific capability expectations for the lrs-b , but indications are that it will be stealth , able to carry conventional and nuclear weapons and could possibly operate both with or without a pilot .. northrop grumman teased an initial structural design for the aircraft in an ad during the super bowl , stopping short of highlighting specific features .. tim paynter , a company spokesman , said the aircraft shown on tv is " representative of any future aircraft our customers may ask us to build . ". generally speaking , deptula said the lrs-b must have long-range capabilities , be able to carry a large payload , have high survivability and have sufficient adaptability to incorporate evolving sensor and weapon technology .. long-range capability provides the air force with the flexibility to persistently respond to threats around the world and reach deep into enemy territory to hit fixed and mobile targets unreachable by cruise missiles , deptula said .. large payload capability allows for operations with fewer aircraft and increases loiter capability and efficiency , he said .. modernized stealth tactics and upgraded electronic warfare capabilities would allow the aircraft to enter enemy airspace without suffering prohibitive losses .. the mysterious long range strike bomber program is the most expensive weapons system under the air force 's $ 17 billion research , development , test and evaluation funding request for 2016 .. the air force requested $ 1.2 billion for the program under the president obama 's $ 534 billion proposed 2016 pentagon budget .. since 2011 , the pentagon has said the lrs-b bomber will cost close to $ 550 million per airplane , projecting a $ 55 billion price total for 100 planes .. critics insist the actual cost of the lrs-b will exceed the initial $ 500 million estimate ; yet pentagon officials continue to publicly tout the cost figure .. " it 's like $ 550 million per copy , " rear adm. john kirby , the pentagon spokesman , said this january .. " it 's an estimate based upon multiple reviews of the program and not a single source . ". laplante acknowledged the target cost of the lrs-b has increased due to inflation since the initial estimate was made in 2010 , saying " $ 55 in 2010 is $ 57 or $ 58 today .. but we put it in as a requirement -- to build 100 airplanes , it 's going to cost $ 550 million ( each ) .. what that does is , that drives the design .. industry has to design to that number and we 're going to assess against that number . ". regardless of the exact cost , deptula said price should not be quantified per individual aircraft , but rather within the context of what the lrs-b system will be able to accomplish compared to the cost of carrying out operations with less-advanced , shorter-range aircraft .. " how can we not afford it ? ". he said , warning a failure to incorporate a combat cloud system could actually exacerbate budget demands .. the pentagon 's future years defense program projects the lrs-b 's budget will increase to $ 3.7 billion for research , development , test and evaluation in 2020 , bringing the total development cost to roughly $ 24 billion , according to the csba .. if air force buys 100 planes by the mid-2030s , the research group estimates the program 's total cost will be closer to $ 90 billion .. the center for strategic and budgetary assessments said intentionally planning to enhance an aircraft 's capabilities over time could also reduce the up-front sticker shock of the lrs-b .. " instead of buying them with all desired mission functionalities when they first roll off the assembly line , it may be possible to equip new combat aircraft with the most essential systems and plan future block upgrades to keep pace with emerging technologies and threats as funding permits , " the group said in a 2014 report .

london ( cnn ) london teenager brusthom ziamani only converted to islam in april last year .. but by august he was arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill a soldier , police officer or government official , with a 12-inch knife and a hammer found in his backpack .. ziamani was convicted in february of " engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts " and sentenced friday at the old bailey to 22 years in prison .. it 's a case with chilling echoes of the shocking murder by two islamist extremists of soldier lee rigby , mowed down and hacked to death with a machete on a street in woolwich , in southeast london , in may 2013 .. on the morning of his arrest , ziamani had told his former girlfriend he intended to attack and kill soldiers .. he also showed her the long-bladed knife and the hammer in his bag .. police who had searched his home two months previously had found a handwritten letter in which he glorified the murder of rigby , and stated that " we should do a 9/11 , 7/7 and a woolwich all in one day .

" he is a man of intelligence and independent and articulate mind .. he was within hours of carrying out his intention of murdering a soldier , police officer or government official to imitate the horrifying savagery carried out by the killers of lee rigby . ". the letter that came to light when counterterror officers from london 's metropolitan police searched ziamani 's address in june gave an insight into an extremist mind-set that already had violence in mind .. found in a pair of jeans , according to police , the letter was messily written with many misspellings .. in it , he tells his " beloved parents " that what he 's about to do is an obligation for muslims and asks them to forgive him for all the stress he 's caused them in the past .. " i 'm a changed person , " he said , saying he has to act to help his " brothers and sisters " in syria and iraq .. because he does not have the means to get to these countries , he will wage war against the british government here instead , he said , adding that it would give the authorities " a taste of there ( sic ) own medicine . ". ziamani admitted writing the letter and was arrested on suspicion of committing a terrorism offense .. he was released on bail , allowing police to continue their inquiries .. police believe he converted to islam in april 2014 and point to his postings on social media as evidence of his rapid radicalization .. in may he posted " land of democracy = evil , " and in july he posted , " forget the protests , the only way to liberate muslim lands is jihad . ". on june 20 , ziamani had used his phone to visit websites researching the locations for army cadet bases across london , police said .. while ziamani was out on bail , officers tasked with trying to divert vulnerable young people from the path to radicalization tried to meet with him three times , but he declined to engage with them , police said .. commander richard walton of the counter terrorism command welcomed the sentence , saying he was " relieved an extremely dangerous individual " had been removed from the streets .. " ziamani was an impressionable young man who became radicalized , then rapidly developed an extremist , violent mind-set , " walton said .. the work of police and intelligence officials had " probably prevented a horrific terrorist attack taking place on the streets of london , " he said .

her books are stuffed full of delicious recipes for meat , game and fish dishes .. but mary berry has revealed there is one animal -- horse -- she will absolutely not cook or eat because it reminds her of a treasured childhood friend .. when she was a girl , the great british bake off judge had a pony called kerry lass .. the pair were so close that when mary was struck down by polio at the age of 13 , her father walked kerry lass four miles to see her at the hospital .. a young mary berry with kerry lass , the pony which comforted her when she was struck down with polio. when mary was better , she went on to win rosettes with kerry lass at pony shows .. so when mary was first served horsemeat , it reduced her to tears .. she explained : ` at 17 i went away to pau in the south of france for a few months to study domestic science , including cleaning windows with newspaper and water , while living with a catholic family with ten children .. ` i 'd left my pony at home and on the journey i kept seeing horses ' heads in villages , then the first night the family served me horsemeat and i cried and i cried .. tears poured down throughout the meal but they took little notice .. ` i was n't allowed in their kitchen during the day and did n't go in there at night because there were rats . '. the tv chef had only been introduced to domestic science the year before .. in an interview with the observer food monthly magazine , she recalled : ` my parents went to the head teacher at bath grammar when i was 16 and said , " what could mary do ? ". and she replied , " i do n't know , very little .. perhaps she could be a child 's nurse . ". when mary was better , she went on to win rosettes with kerry lass at pony shows .. above the horse visits her in hospital. in an interview the 79-year-old said she first took up baking at school when domestic science was offered as a subject. ` and my father said , " i 'd pity the child . ". but i was in the first bunch of pupils who could choose between latin and maths and domestic science ... and there was a brand new domestic science department .. ` i 'd never baked with mother but when i brought home a treacle pudding , father said it was as good as mother made . '. miss berry , 79 , also said that she struggled with her weight in her younger years .. ` i got chubby as a teen , and then , when my children were young , i was half at home and half at work and there were all their crusts available at home and all my cooking and testing at work , and it all went on my bottom , as it may .. ` but i 've had my bottom under control for the last few years ! '. and the wine-loving presenter revealed that she has n't touched a drop of alcohol following her knee-replacement surgery in january .. ` each night since , my husband has said , " a glass of wine , mary ? ". and i 've said no .. but ... i think i 'd better get back to normal ! '
dining in a social setting can be one of life 's finest pleasures , where the wine flows as freely as the conversation .. however , certain foods can leave you on a collision course with culinary faux pas where , at best , you 're left feeling awkward and , at worst , said dish ends up covering you or your companions .. just ask ed miliband , who probably never wants to see a bacon sandwich again after photos of the labour leader doing battle with a particularly gristly rasher were widely ridiculed .. gurning for change : labour leader ed miliband was caught out by a bacon sandwich earlier this year. how not to do it : nigel farage , left , and boris johnson , right , have both come unstuck while sampling foods on the political trail. with an election on the way and plenty of opportunities for the nation 's politicians to make fools of themselves eating in public , william hanson , a leading expert and consultant in etiquette and protocol tells femail everything you need to know about how to eat some of the trickiest foods without rendering yourself a culinary fool .. william says : ` nothing can put one off a fellow dining companion more than seeing them messily tackle what 's on their plate .. ` we now see politicians , tv masterchefs and competing dinner guests badly eat their victuals so perhaps now , if it is not too late , i give them ( and you ) my guide on how to best tuck in to some of the trickiest foods to tackle . '. if served as a first course , rather than an accompaniment vegetable , these are eaten with the hands and dipped into the hollandaise sauce .. rules of etiquette : never double-dip asparagus ... unless you have your own personal pot of sauce. brits will eat these with the left hand ( leaving the right hand free of grease , ready to shake hands or pick up a wine glass , for example ) ; there are some cultures where eating with the left hand is not the done thing , in this case , they may eat the asparagus with the right hand .. ( not many know the left-hand rule today . ). you may double-dip in the sauce so long as it is your own portion .. if in doubt , go for the banana , says william : the fruit is easy to unwrap with a knife and fork. fruit is served as part of the dessert course ( dessert was traditionally the fruit course at the end of the meal , whereas today people confuse it with the sweet course ) .. at state banquets , such as the recent one for mexico at buckingham palace , fruit is still served as a palate cleanser .. a banana is always the easiest fruit to pick .. cut both ends off with dessert cutlery ( very sharp ) , slice down the skin to unwrap , and then cut off slices and eat with a fork and knife .. the russians tend to consume caviar from the small pad of flesh between the thumb and the forefinger ( again , on the left hand ) .. this , however , looks beyond pretentious in a social setting and is thus best avoided .. instead , scoop a small bit on to your plate and use a thin piece of toast or a blini to consume .. one-way ticket to inelegance : if corn on the cob is offered , say no ... if it 's served , then just chow down. the little prongs you often get given are naff -- especially the solid silver ones ( a rare instance where plastic would be preferably , but not by much ) .. hosts really should n't serve corn this way unless it 's a barbecue ( and a pretty feral one at that ) .. if you get offered it , politely decline .. if you get served it , with naff prongs , then pick it up and gnaw away .. everyone else will be in the same inelegant boat as you .. special clamps are often used to hold the shell in place whilst a small , two-pronged fork is held in the right hand and used to pierce and scoop the fleshy meat from within .. william insists you use a fork to tackle a langoustine and advises against sucking .... using a small fork upturned in the right hand , scoop out the white fleshy meat from the tail .. your left hand can be used to secure the shell as you daintily perform your excavation ( a finger bowl should be provided ) .. you may see some people pick up the animal to suckle the head -- these people are to be treated with the greatest of social caution .. moules be sorry : use empty shells as would-be tweezers to help you pluck the flesh from other mussels , says william ... and always make use of the finger bowl. the most elegant method is to use a fork to loosen and consume the first mollusc within , before using the empty shell to tweeze out the other mussels , discarding redundant shells on a nearby plate .. a finger bowl should also be present , to the left of the setting .. dip one hand in at a time to wash away the grease .. a skilled high-society habitué will know that these are really only eaten in months containing the letter r .. the upmarket way to eat is to simply tip the contents into the mouth from the shell , having loosened the contents beforehand with a fork .. an oyster fork is a victorian middle-class invention and does nothing a normal fork can not do .. if an oyster fork is set , use it .. if not , just use a normal small fork .. peas release me : scooping is a no-no , spearing is really the only way to go with the little green spheres. good hosts will never serve these at a formal dinner party , but if you find yourself confronted by petit pois or the like resist the urge to turn your fork over and scoop .. instead , use the tines of the fork to spear a collection and transfer to the mouth .. if mashed potato has been served , or something similar , use that as a ` glue ' .. eaten , never drunk : soup should be pushed away from the diner and then gently tipped into the mouth. soup is always ` eaten ' , never drunk .. the soup spoon is held in the right hand and scoops away from you on one side , skimming the surface .. then sip from the nearside of the spoon .. tipping the bowl away from you at the end to help you catch the last few mouthfuls is perfectly fine .. if bread is served with the soup ( let 's hope not a slice of bread -- a bit ` try-hard gastropub ' ) never cut the roll .. break a bite-sized chunk off , butter if desired , and eat .. it is not the done thing to divide the bread into two , slather with butter and gnaw away .. do n't be caught out as an air-butterer , either -- apply the butter to the roll on the plate , not in the air .. spaghetti can be a nightmare for diners and is best avoided in formal social situations ... the one golden rule with pasta is never to cut it , an act of culinary terrorism in italy , no less , according to william ( right ). this is eaten with a fork alone and never cut with a knife .. the idea of using a spoon as well comes from the usa but is not practised in authentic italian homes or upmarket british ones .. spaghetti can be messy , so avoid ordering this on a date or when dining with clients .. the good news is , at a formal dinner ( or even a semi-formal soiree ) spaghetti will not be served .. when in italy , never cut your pasta -- doing so is considered an act of culinary terrorism and insult to the cook .. my thanks to one of london 's leading restaurants , l'atelier de joël robuchon , for their delicious food which , with the above tips , is very easy to eat .. etiquette comes first ... but if you get really stuck , then just bluff your way through , says william. it is the guests ' responsibility upon accepting an invitation to alert their hosts as to their dietary requirements .. experienced hosts may just wish to check with those who have n't been invited to their ` casa ' before that the guest does n't have any life-threatening allergies just to be on the safe side and to stop the impending drama that comes with a guest who suddenly says they are a vegan , rendering your osso bucco ( braised veal ) useless .. if dining in a restaurant , staff should be well versed in what dishes are suitable for your individual needs .. occasionally , we get served something that is so tasteless , bland or inedible that persevering is just not an option .. in which case , your strategy is to eat as much of it as you can muster , push it to one side and devour everything else .. hosts should not then question you as to whether you liked it or not .. if they do , reply , smiling , with ` i enjoyed what i had , thank you ' .. what to do when this guide fails you. there may very well be an occasion where a food that is not on my guide is set down before you and you are flummoxed as to how best to tackle the tricky food .. your plan should be to watch what method your host , or the most learned guest , is using to eat the food and copy .. even if it is not technically correct , they will think it is and so you can bluff your way through the meal ... and then get home and research the proper way to eat it so you are n't caught out again !
a wave of migrants 4,500 years ago left their trace in the dna and languages of modern europeans .. this is according to a study that found evidence of this stone age migration by analysing dna of 69 people who lived across europe between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago .. among the shifts in the genetic make-up of ancient europeans they found that dna associated with the yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern germany .. researchers have identified a mass migration of kurgan populations ( yamna culture ) which went from the russian steppes to the centre of europe 4,500 years ago .. previously , researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east , now modern day turkey , brought it to europe. there are two main theories as to how indo-european languages spread in europe .. the first is the anatolian hypothesis , which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east ( currently turkey ) brought it to europe .. the kurgan hypothesis , meanwhile , proposes that the language was spread by nomadic herders of the steppes found to the north of the black and caspian sea .. this theory suggests their language spread throughout europe after the invention of wheeled vehicles , from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago .. the yamnaya were herders who lived in the steppe north of the black and aral seas .. this injection of dna indicates ' a massive migration into the heartland of europe from its eastern periphery , ' said the researchers , led by david reich of harvard medical school .. such a large-scale influx would likely have affected not just the dna but ancient cultures as well .. although genes ca n't determine what people spoke , the researchers argue that their findings could influence the debate about the origins of indo-european tongues .. indo-european languages include more than 400 tongues , from modern languages such as english and polish to ancient languages like hittite and sanskrit .. basque , which is spoken in south-west france and northern spain , is not indo-european , and may be the only surviving relic of earlier languages once spoken more widely , according to the bbc .. linguists have long debated whether indo-european languages came to europe with farmers migrating from the middle east or some other group , such as the yamnaya .. previously , researchers had believed that indo-european language spread some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east , now modern day turkey , brought it to europe .. the latest study suggests that europe was first reshaped at this time in what archaeologists call the neolithic revolution .. farmers from anatolia travelled north , bringing new technology and language into europe .. this was followed by a second wave of people several thousand years later from what is today ukraine and russia .. the latest study suggests that europe was first reshaped during the neolithic revolution 8,500 years ago .. farmers at this time travelled north , bringing new technology and language into europe .. pictured is an early neolithic 35-40 year old male from , czech republic , who was part of the first mass migration to europe. as well as genetic evidence , researchers point to the fact that many indo-european languages share words for things like axles , harness poles , and the wheel .. these devices were invented long after the neolithic revolution began in europe .. ` major language replacements are thought to require large-scale migration , ' said the authors of the study , which was published monday by the journal nature .. ` our results make a compelling case for the steppe as a source of at least some of the indo-european languages in europe . '. andrew garrett , a linguist at the university of california , berkeley , who was not involved in the study , said it was significant that the mass migration occurred at a time some models had previously identified for indo-european expansion .. ` it fills in a significant piece of a big and interesting puzzle , ' said garrett .
tony abbott has again showed the nation that he has a big mouth , but this time he chose to put it around a large , fresh onion - with the skin still intact .. on a tour of a produce farm in tasmania on friday , abbott shocked unsuspecting onlookers as he impulsively bit into a raw , unpeeled , brown onion .. footage shows our prime minister grimacing slightly as he bites into the strong , bitter vegetable but then nodding in approval as if he were merely chowing down on an apple .. prime minister tony abbott has shocked onlooker when he bit into a raw , unpeeled onion at a produce farm. abbott seemed unphased by the peculiarity of the stunt and merely looked as if he were eating a fresh apple. the public took to the twitter sphere to mock and patronise the prime minister. some compared him to other mps , others labelled him ` the minister for onions '. many have taken to twitter to slam abbott for yet another bizarre stunt .. most of the tweets aim to mock and patronise the prime minister relating him to george costanza from seinfield , an ogre with layers , a robot and ` the minister for onions . '. ` looking forward to bill shorten responding to tony eating a raw onion by daringly chomping into a roast potato , ' read one tweet .. abbott pictured here in a banana factory just created an opening for more ridicule. the hashtag oniongate has been trending on social media since friday when the onion incident took place. many of the messages on twitter aimed to patronise the pm , comparing him to an ogre , a robot and a child '. i may have said ` it 's a shame they were n't peeled , ' said charlton farm produce owner david addison. ` better than any other onions i 've eaten in a long time ' abbott was reported to have said. ` in other news , pm tony abbott shows approval of local vegetable oil manufacturer by dipping his hands into a deep fryer , ' said another .. abbott was touring woolworths supplier , charlton farm produce near devonport in tasmania on friday when he picked up the brown onion during a demonstration of the grading of the post-harvested vegetables .. ` better than any other onions i 've eaten in a long time , ' the sydney morning herald reported abbott said after his meal .. the prime minister shocked onlookers as he spontaneously picked up the vegetable during a food grading. abbott was touring woolworths supplier , charlton farm produce near devonport in tasmania. tony abbott has recently been criticised for a st. patrick 's day message labelled ` patronising '. according to the hobart 's mercury , the owner of charlton farm produce , david addison was surprised at the prime minister 's impulsive move during a general discussion of brown onions . '. i may have said ` it 's a shame they were n't peeled ' and he just started eating it , ' he said .. ` it was just spontaneous and there were n't even any tears . '. this stunt has come after abbott was blasted by the public for his st. patrick 's day video that was labelled patronising and controversial .
one in three 11-year-olds is still overweight or obese - but an expert has warned that the country 's fat youngsters are now ` getting fatter '. britain now has 140,000 ` super-fat ' children who will need gastric bands as adults if they do not slim down , according to a leading expert .. the number of seriously overweight children has soared in recent years as ministers have failed to tackle the problem , said professor paul gately .. official statistics suggest childhood obesity rates have plateaued in recent years -- although one in three 11-year-olds is still overweight or obese .. but prof gately , who treats obese patients , said the figures disguised the fact that the country 's fat youngsters were now ` getting fatter ' .. speaking at an event to discuss whether people were too worried about childhood obesity , he said the problem was ` much worse ' than many feared .. overall rates had stabilised , but only because middle-class families had started heeding advice to eat healthily and take more exercise , he said .. he added : ` unfortunately , those children who are already obese are getting fatter .. so more deprived communities are getting more obese . '. he continued : ` we have 140,000 children in the uk who are so obese that if they were adults they would be immediately eligible for surgery . '. society had to ` think very carefully about that ' , he told a meeting at the policy exchange think-tank in london , because ` obese children tend to become obese adults ' .. under recently published guidelines , adults should be considered for weight-loss surgery if they have a body mass index ( bmi ) of 30 or more and ` very poorly controlled ' type 2 diabetes .. a bmi of 30 is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 13st 9lb , or a 5ft 11in man of 15st 6lb .. any patient with type 2 diabetes and a bmi over 35 should also be considered for weight-reduction surgery , according to the national institute for health and care excellence .. britain now has 140,000 ` super-fat ' children who will need gastric bands as adults if they do not slim down. teenagers rarely have fat-loss surgery , with only 60 such operations taking place last year .. however , as the mail on sunday revealed last month , patients are getting younger , with a 12-year-old boy recently going under the knife .. prof gately , an exercise and obesity specialist at leeds metropolitan university , believes successive governments squandered billions on scattergun attempts to protect all children from obesity -- when only some were actually ` at risk ' .. arguing many obese people were victims of circumstance , he claimed the current government 's policy of emphasising ` personal responsibility ' over weight led to people feeling blamed , which was counterproductive .. rofessor paul gately ( pictured ) says the number of seriously overweight children has soared in recent years as ministers have failed to tackle the problem. and he accused local councils of spending only minuscule amounts on obesity prevention or on helping those affected , even though the problems ` dwarfed ' other public health issues that had money lavished on them , such as sexually transmitted infections .. tam fry , of the national obesity forum , said : ` if we only had a real policy for preventing children from getting fat in the first place , we would not have ridiculous figures like this . '. mr fry said he believed more teenagers should undergo fat-loss surgery , adding that gastric bands were proven to help patients lose weight and keep it off .. but weight-loss motivator steve miller countered : ` why should parents expect the taxpayer to pay for their child to go on the operating table , because they have been so irresponsible as to let them get so fat ? '. he added : ` gastric bands do n't treat the underlying reasons why a child is obese , which could be caused by emotional problems or self-esteem issues . '. former tory health secretary andrew lansley , who also spoke at the policy exchange event , said the government 's health initiatives had helped make food healthier -- cutting salt and fat levels , and reducing the nation 's intake by billions of calories a day .. and he said it was right to stress personal responsibility because it was important that people realised they could take action to cut their weight .
it has been talked about and hyped-up for more than a year , but a basic evolutionary instinct could end up putting people off buying the new apple iwatch .. for once it is nothing to do with the price of the wearable technology , but the basic layout of the screen can apparently trigger a sense of ` fear ' in those who are susceptible .. the hexagonal appearance of the iwatch 's apps on its small screen can cause trypophobia which is a fear of holes .. some potential buyers of the new apple iwatch ( left ) say they are suffering from panic attacks and feelings of trypophobia after seeing the layout of the screen. honey to the bee : trypophobia is the uncontrollable and completely irrational fear of objects that have an irregular pattern of holes. in fact , the reaction can be so severe that even seeing photos of holes can set off a panic attack .. until recently , it did n't garner much attention from scientists or doctors .. however the phenomenon appears to be more widespread than first thought .. there is a facebook group devoted to those who believe they are sufferers .. according to the website trypophobia.com , the phobia is a ` weird kind ' and is generally considered as the fear of shapes .. usually , the fear is caused by shapes created by nature such as the holes in a beehive or the seeds in a pod , but if arranged in the right order , man-made objects such as the iwatch can also elicit a similar response .. a number of people have now taken to twitter to voice their reaction at seeing the display for the hi-tech device .. ` the apple watch is a cluster of circles no no no no ' , wrote one , whilst another showed a similar reaction : ` anyone else getting a weird trypophobic reaction to the apple watch ?. i 'm sorry i ever learned about that phobia existing ! '. side by side : twitter is now full of comparisons between the iwatch and occurrences in nature of. weird : many people do not realize they have the phobia until they see an object that triggers the reaction. trypophobia is not recognized as a condition in the american psychiatric association 's diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders or other scientific literature. apple unveiled the much-anticipated apple watch on monday .. the basic watch sells for $ 349 , but other models sell for $ 10,000 and higher .. a couple of years ago , researchers at the university of essex conducted research into the phobia .. it was concluded that it is not the holes that people fear but their brains associating the holes with danger .. the study suggested the widespread , predominantly latent phobia is associated with ancient threats such as beehives , poisonous flowers and venomous creatures .. the reaction to these holes is intense .. ` these can make them feel that their skin is crawling , shudder , feel itchy and physically sick when seeing these images because they really find it disgusting and gross .. some of these people think that something might be living inside those holes and some of them are afraid that they might fall in these holes , ' the website explains .. despite people trying to convince themselves that there is no danger , not least from a watch , trypophobes have an unconscious reflex reaction that they ca n't control .. human nature : the holes , or images of holes , stimulate ' a primitive portion of his or her brain that associates the image with something dangerous '
tony fernandes thought queens park rangers were not getting enough out of their players .. he thought the younger ones should get more of a chance .. darnell furlong , 19 , was removed at half-time against crystal palace and replaced by a 36-year-old with flu , having been given a terrible time by yannick bolasie .. palace were leading 3-0 by then .. adel taarabt played a full 90 minutes and looked heavy and poor .. so there was no secret stash of talent , ignored by the previous manager .. darnell furlong ( right ) finds it tough going against glenn murray and was substituted at half-time. charlie austin tries to point adel taarabt in the right direction but qpr look to be heading down. fighting relegation all season , rangers would have been one of the easiest teams to make .. a talented youngster or an outcast like taarabt would have been instantly recalled had there been the slightest spark or inclination .. there are some clubs -- and tim sherwood has proved that aston villa are one -- where an underachieving group can be energised .. that is n't the case at qpr .. the best players were playing and were n't good enough .. it really was no more complicated than that .. austin ( left ) looks dejected with team-mates steven caulker and flu-victim clint hill , who replaced furlong. tony fernandes will be in no doubt now that the players at loftus road are not good enough to stay up
scotland yard detectives swooped on the family home of field marshall lord bramall of bushfield , the former chief of the defence staff and a d-day veteran. at 91 , lord bramall -- the latest vip to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry -- is the oldest and most respected of britain 's eight living field marshals .. he stepped down as chief of defence staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd lieutenant right to the pinnacle of britain 's armed forces .. lord bramall first saw action on the normandy beaches the day after d-day , when he was shelled .. everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out .. at first he thought he was on fire , but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to britain for treatment .. lord bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the dutch-belgian border when he was ambushed .. rather than flee , he led a counter-attack , and managed to wound two germans and take another one captive .. he was later awarded the military cross for his actions by field marshal montgomery himself .. he led the royal green jackets in borneo in 1965 , commanded british forces in hong kong in the 1970s and was made head of the army in 1979 .. lord bramall held that role during the falklands war of 1982 , and was a strong admirer of margaret thatcher . '. a wonderful war leader , ' he said , ` probably even better than churchill ' .. born in 1923 , lord bramall 's father came from a merchant family in the potteries in staffordshire , while his mother hailed from impoverished aristocracy .. she would forever call him ` my baby ' -- even when phoning his office while he was head of the army .. he captained eton 's cricket team , had two pictures displayed at the royal academy , and to his mother 's chagrin , turned down a place at oxford to join the army .. he married his wife avril in 1949 and they have two children .. the couple are still together .. after he retired , festooned with decorations , he became a life peer -- and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the lords -- opposing the second war in iraq and what he termed ` mission creep ' in afghanistan .. more recently , lord bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts , which he fears could weaken the army .. he told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you ` have to prepare for the unexpected ' .. eton-educated lord bramall commanded a platoon at the d-day landings and led the army as chief of the general staff during the falklands campaign.he was awarded the military cross in 1945. the headline to an earlier version of this article wrongly stated that lord bramall had been arrested .. while the article made clear that this had not been the case , we are happy to set the record straight and apologise for any confusion caused .
why and how certain types of mushrooms glow has long confused scientists , but now they think they might have an answer .. it appears that some fungi emit light to attract insects at night , which then spread their fungal spores around .. and interestingly , the mushrooms are also able to sync up their ability with the circadian clock , so they only become bioluminescent when it is dark .. scientists in brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow .. they found the ability helps them attract insects at night .. these creatures will then move their fungal spores elsewhere .. but the mushrooms are able to turn off the ability during the day .. the research , published in the journal current biology , was led by the university of sao paulo .. among bioluminescent organisms , fungi are the most rare and least understood .. of more than 100,000 species of fungi , only 71 are known to produce green light , a process that uses oxygen and energy .. scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism , but based on new evidence it seems that is n't so .. the effect is triggered by a chemical reaction between luciferin , a light-emitting pigment , and the enzyme luciferase .. it can occur in fungi as well as in a range of animals including jellyfish , squid , scorpions and other insects .. in fact , the mushrooms ' glow appears to be under the control of a temperature-compensated circadian clock .. this level of control helps them ` save energy ' during hours of daylight when they do not need to grow .. at night , the green glow attracts insects including beetles , flies , wasps and ants .. ` it appears that fungi make light so they are noticed by insects who can help the fungus colonize new habitats , ' said dr cassius stevani of brazil 's instituto de química-universidade de são paulo .. the circadian control of bioluminescence makes the process more efficient .. ` regulation implies an adaptive function for bioluminescence , ' added dr jay dunlap of dartmouth 's geisel school of medicine .. here the species neonothopanus gardneri is seen during the day , when its bioluminescent ability ` turns off ' in order to conserve energy .. scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism , but based on this new evidence it seems that is n't so. to make the findings , the researchers made sticky , fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green led lights ( shown ) .. when those pretend fungi were placed in the forest , the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms. the research focused on neonothopanus gardneri , one of the biggest and brightest of bioluminescent mushrooms .. n. gardneri is also called ` flor de coco , ' meaning coconut flower , by locals in brazil , where the mushroom can be found attached to leaves at the base of young palm trees in coconut forests .. other fungi have other methods to disperse their spores like the common stinkhorn ( shown ) , which releases a foul smell to get flies to attract flies. to make the findings , the researchers made sticky , fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green led lights .. when those pretend fungi were placed in the forest where the real bioluminescent mushrooms are found , the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms .. the team are now hoping to identify the genes responsible for the mushrooms ' bioluminescence , and aims to explore their interaction with the circadian clock that controls them .. they are also using infrared cameras to watch the interaction between n. gardneri mushrooms and arthropods , especially larger ones , more closely .. and the findings could also reveal how mushrooms are dispersed by insects , which is important because n. gardneri plays a key role in forest ecosystems .. ` without them , cellulose would be stuck in its form , which would impact the whole carbon cycle on earth , ' said dr stevani . '. i dare to say that life on earth depends on organisms like these .

trendy winter coat manufacturer canada goose is being accused of being cruel to animals and covering up the truth about it , daily mail online can disclose .. the hugely successful maker of fur-lined coats is the subject of legal action claiming that it has deliberately deceived consumers , exploited animal welfare concerns with disingenuous marketing and concealed the reality of chilling cruelty and animal suffering on which their multi-million dollar business is built .. the shocking allegations are made against the manufacturer in a legal complaint filed against the company last week in canada .. the complaint has been filed by animal justice canada legislative fund and calls for independent law enforcement agency the competition bureau of canada to ` investigate canada goose for its multiple intentional misrepresentations . '. fashion forward : sports illustrated model erin heatherton is one of the many celebrities who have helped make canada goose the must-have winter brand. caught : campaigners claim coyotes trapped and skinned for their fur to trim the hoods of canada goose coats can be in pain for days .. it is unclear whether these images are from canada goose trappers but the firm does use the same leg holds. ugly : exhausted , alone and all out of fight , this coyote awaits its inevitable fate having been caught in a trap by its right hind leg. fan following : krysten ritter models one of the coats with coyote fur-lined hoods .. the brand is diversifying into other apparel too , such as the down jacket worn by hugh jackman ( right ). endorsed : the company is marketed by british celebrity ben fogle , who presents ben fogle 's animal clinic and has spoken out on other animal cruelty issues including the killing of rhinos and the killing of zoo animals. canada goose has become one of the most recognizable brands when it comes to winter jacket , coats and parkas .. they have made america their new frontier , forging into the us clothing market with worldwide sales topping $ 176 million last year - up 4,000 per cent in a decade .. in november last year it opened its own store in west chelsea , one of new york 's most prestigious shopping areas , and it also sells at high-end stores such as barney 's , bergdorf goodman , , bloomingdales and neiman marcus .. earlier this year it opened a new factory in toronto to cope with soaring demand .. celebrities are regularly seen wearing the trademark coyote fur-trimmed , down jackets and the brand has established itself as the go-to label for the well-known and the well-heeled braving the frigid conditions that continue to bite .. last year 's sports illustrated cover featured kate upton wearing a canada goose jacket and little else .. other celebrities seen wearing the brand have included hugh jackman , the wolverine star , and sports illustrated model erin heatherton .. it is endorsed by ben fogle , the british animal television show presenter , who has also spoken out against animal cruelty .. but according to the legal complaint , seen by daily mail online , consumers are being duped into thinking they are making either an ethical choice or buying the best product when they purchase canada goose .. in the document animal justice canada legislative fund has accused the company of , ` engaging in a persistent pattern of using deceptive practices to market its winter jackets by repeatedly misleading consumers with respect to the nature and quality of its jackets which include coyote fur . '. the complaint attacks canada goose on its claims that the coyote fur used in its jackets is in any way ethically or humanely obtained .. distressed : a coyote is caught in a snare of the same type used by canada goose trappers. snared : campaigners claim that coyotes caught like this can take days to die. canada goose 's website claims that the company is ` deeply committed to the preservation of our global environment and the humane treatment of animals . '. it goes on , ` we never purchase fur from fur farms , never use fur from endangered animals , and only purchase from certified canadian trappers . '. these trappers are governed by the agreement on international humane trapping standards ( aihts ) and their pelts are purchased by canada goose through north american fur auctions ( nafa ) .. according to canada goose the nafa ` monitors very closely ' the practices of the trappers selling through it .. according to animal justice canada legislative fund it does nothing of the sort .. instead , they claim : ` there is no mechanism within the nafa to provide any degree of oversight of the trapping practices of the trappers from which nafa accepts consignment pelts . '. nafa , it states , does not monitor trappers .. it is not an oversight body ; it is a commercial fur auction house .. nor does the aihts bring the guarantee of humane methods explicit in canada goose 's claims .. the aihts simply requires canada to ` phase out ' certain types of traps -- traps , animal justice canada claims , that are still used by the trappers selling to canada goose .. what canada goose says : the faqs on the firm 's website form part of the animal rights group 's case against the successful manufacturer .. they say that the trappers are not monitored to be sure that act humanely. design classic : canada goose 's women 's trillium coat in military green. in demand : the company predicts double digit sales growth for the foreseeable future. and so while consumers believe every effort is being made to ensure that the fur they are wearing when they buy a canada goose coat has been secured with minimal animal suffering and maximum human oversight , they are , animal justice canada insists , being deceived .. coyotes are caught in leg hold traps that inflict injuries including fractures , severance of tendons and ligaments , severe bleeding , spinal cord injury , organ damage and amputation of limbs .. despite these horrific injuries the animal may survive long enough to be clubbed , suffocated or strangled to death by the trapper.to dispatch an animal swiftly with a bullet would spoil the pelt .. body gripping traps and snares - metal nooses - are also used inflicting similar injury and failing to deliver the swift ` humane ' death implied in canada goose 's marketing material .. the fur institute of canada , which promotes the interests of the fur industry , believes a ` humane ' death is on that occurs within 300 seconds .. according to animal justice canada : ' .. under laboratory conditions , it takes approximately eight minutes ... for a snare to strangle a coyote -- three minutes longer than what even the fur industry itself claims to be humane . '. as for the company 's assertion that they do not use the pelt of endangered species , animal justice canada points out that the traps set for coyotes are indiscriminate in the animals they capture .. marketing : canada goose uses canada 's arctic circle to highlight the warmth of its jackets. more fans : jodie foster ( left ) keeps warm in a canada goose jacket while filming in new york , while olivia wilde wears one to run errands in the city. key among canada goose 's defense of their use of real fur is their insistence that in , ` the coldest places on earth ... fur is not just the best choice , but the only choice . '. speaking on their website , danny reis , the president and ceo of canada goose , explains : ` we use coyote fur for a number of reasons .. number one , coyote fur works .. it 's functional ; it provides warmth around the face in a way that no synthetic fabric can .. it does that in the coldest environments in earth , and it 's important to realize that sometimes urban centers and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth . '. we 're confident in both why we use fur and how it is sourced , and people should know this is not something we take lightly .. our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products , how it is sourced , and the government-regulated practices of the canadian fur industry .. like many proud canadians , we do n't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong .. we understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that .. we also understand that despite the fact that numerous brands also use real fur in their products and do not attempt to explain their position , it is our very openness and transparency around this subject that makes canada goose a target for activist groups whose views will never align with ours .. we are proud to support an industry practice that supports northern and rural communities in canada , and of our continued role as an educator on this matter .. the narrator then states : ` coyote fur , unlike fake fur , does n't hold moisture , retains heat and is biodegradable . '. in its legal complaint animal justice canada says : ` there is no scientific proof to support canada goose 's claim that coyote fur is more protective of the face , in a way that ` no synthetic material ' can be . '. this is not the first time canada goose has fallen foul of animal rights campaigners .. last year daily mail online revealed that people for the ethical treatment of animals ( peta ) was calling for the company to stop using coyote fur and to stop supporting the trapping of animals , ` in a way that is inherently cruel . '. speaking to daily mail online then lindsay rajt , director of campaigns for peta described the horrific reality of animal trapping .. she said : ` the company 's reference to aihts standards is meaningless and a way of placating and silencing people with valid concerns .. ` leg hold traps are still legal in canada .. mothers will chew off their limbs in order to get back to their young .. the trapped animal might be there for days before the trapper finds them .. they are frightened and starving and in pain during that time .. and then they 're bludgeoned or strangled to death . '. additionally peta has called for the company to replace its goose down -- which is obtained as a by-product of the poultry industry - and opt for ` revolutionary synthetic technology ' already used by competitor , north face .. but according to ms rajt peta 's repeated attempts to meet with canada goose have been stonewalled .. now , animal justice canada legislative fund , has called for the competition bureau to investigate the company for its ` multiple intentional misrepresentations on its website . '. and it has urged the body to ` take all appropriate enforcement action to ensure that canada goose is accountable ' for the ` false and misleading information that it has willfully directed at consumers . '. canada goose said that it rejected any claims it had misinformed customers but said it could never satisfy activists entirely opposed to fur .. a spokesman said : ` our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products , how it is sourced , and the government-regulated practices of the canadian fur industry .. ` like many proud canadians , we do n't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong .. we understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that .

kevin pietersen 's former test captain andrew strauss remains convinced it is ` very unlikely ' the record-breaking batsman will ever play for england again .. pietersen , sacked by the england and wales cricket board after the 2013-14 ashes defeat , has set his heart on pushing for a return in time for this summer 's rematch .. the 34-year-old signed for surrey on wednesday , to that end - and after indications from new ecb chairman colin graves that he may yet be considered again for selection , he is hoping a welter of county championship runs over the next two months could press his claims .. andrew strauss ( right ) believes kevin pietersen 's efforts to play himself back into the england test team for thei summer 's series with australia will be in vain. pietersen has rejoined surrey and will attempt to find his form in the county championship. pietersen in action for surrey during a t20 blast fixture at the kia oval last summer. strauss , however , predicts pietersen 's efforts will be in vain .. the dual ashes-winning captain believes pietersen 's age and history of confrontation are against him , and suggests his only realistic chance of resuming his international career is if an ` extraordinary ' sequence of events first cost either or both of coach peter moores and test captain alastair cook their jobs .. strauss had his own difficult times with his fellow south africa-born batsman , including the 2012 saga in which pietersen admitted sending ` provocative ' texts about his captain to opposition players .. the contents of pietersen 's autobiography , published five months ago and including much criticism of several ex-colleagues and management staff , may be another barrier to his recall .. strauss told sky sports news : ` if you just look at everything that has gone on in the past ... his book ... that 's a significant hurdle he 'll have to get over .. ` then also , from a cricketing point of view , in one-day cricket we 've got to build towards the next world cup .. strauss and pietersen together during happier times - the victorious 2011 test series against india. the pair celebrate with the trophy after england 's victory in that 2011 series with india. ` kevin pietersen ( will be ) 36 years of age , ( so ) i ca n't see how he would necessarily play in that .. ` also , in the test match arena , our top five or six have all been in excellent form .. ` so it 's not as if there is an obvious place in the side for him either . '. england will head to the west indies next week , for three tests , and graves has already made it clear he will not tolerate defeat there against ` mediocre ' opposition .. graves ' hint that pietersen 's england career might not be finished after all is at odds , meanwhile , with all other public remarks from within the ecb .. strauss appears impressed by pietersen 's willingness to play county cricket again , after agreeing his release from the majority of his indian premier league contract with sunrisers hyderabad .. but he will still be shocked if it leads to an england return . '. i think you ca n't fault his ambition , ' strauss added .. pietersen and strauss at the crease together during england 's test series with pakistan in abu dhabi in 2012. pietersen was axed by england following unrest during last winter 's turbulent ashes tour to australia. ` he 's doing everything right , putting himself in position .. he felt that colin graves offered him an olive branch , and he 's taking it with both hands ... obviously he 's going to have to go out there and score runs .. ` but i have to say i still think it 's very unlikely that he 'll play for england again .. ` it 's going to take something extraordinary , england to lose a lot of games and for pietersen to score a lot of runs - and probably for a captain or a coach , or both , to lose their jobs in the process . '. strauss senses too that it will be this summer or never for pietersen , who will be 35 by the time the ashes begin in july .. ` i 'd be surprised if he plays in this ashes series - and if he does n't , then it 's counter-intuitive that he would then come back in the side when they 'd be building again towards the next ashes series in two-and-a-half years ' time .. ` there would have to be a lot of things that go wrong with the england cricket team between now and the start of the ashes for him to come back .

wisconsin lawmakers voted friday to make their state the 25th to enact ` right-to-work ' legislation , pushing a fast-tracked bill through the assembly after an overnight debate and sending it on to gov. scott walker for his promised signature .. the assembly passed the bill 62-35 after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate .. it was a straight party-line vote , with no democrats backing the contentious measure that will ban unions from forcing non-members to pay dues .. a likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago , walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on monday .. ` today is the day we have solidified the regressive era in wisconsin , ' democratic rep. terese berceau , of madison , said minutes before the vote .. a likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago , wisconsin gov. scott walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on monday. mary will , left , with local 68 , and corey smith , right , with local 113 , chant ` union strong ' during a rally inside the wisconsin state capitol as the state assembly debates the right-to-work bill in madison , wisconsin on thursday .. the assembly passed the bill 62-35 on friday after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate. wisconsin assembly speaker robin vos , a republican , walks off the floor after passage of right-to-work on friday .. the bill passed on a party-line vote , with republicans in support and all democrats against .. the senate passed it last week. the proposal would make it a crime punishable by up to nine months in jail to require private-sector workers who are n't in a union to pay dues .. supporters argued it would make wisconsin more attractive to businesses looking to move in or expand .. but opponents said the goal is to destroy unions , which tend to vote democrat , and a right-to-work law would depress wage and create more dangerous workplaces , in turn hurting the economy .. twenty-four other states have right-to-work laws .. michigan and indiana were the two most recent states to enact it , both in 2012 .. the protests from unions in wisconsin were not nearly as large as they were four years ago when walker and republicans in the state legislature pushed through reforms to public sector unions , growing only as large as about 3,000 people compared with 100,000 in 2011 .. and only a handful of protesters were on hand for friday 's deliberations .. two people were arrested thursday for refusing to stop screaming profanities , a spokesman for walker 's administration said .. the vote came after walker said in september , during his re-election campaign , that right-to-work was not a priority and would n't come up this session .. walker called it a distraction and feared that protests would grow as large as those in 2011 when he effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers. legislative leaders , including republican assembly speaker robin vos , also said right-to-work would not be debated .. but two weeks ago , when senate republicans said they were going forward with it , walker said he would sign it. pointing out that ` the bill would be dead if he opposed ' it , arnold shober , a political science professor at lawrence university in appleton , wisconsin , told tpm last week that walker had to side with his party on the issue .. ` he knows that it will court controversy , but he can not afford to lose potential gop primary voters , ' shober said .. a protester chants outside of the assembly chamber during debate on right-to-work legislation at the state capitol on thursday .. opponents say the goal of the proposal is to destroy unions , which tend to vote democrat. opponents of the wisconsin legislature 's ` right-to-work ' measure rallied at the state capitol last saturday .. the proposal , due to be signed next week by walker , would outlaw the mandatory payment of union dues from workers. ` legislative leaders know this , and see now as an opportunity to pass right-leaning legislation while the state political climate is very favorable . '. walker is scheduled to be in iowa for an agriculture summit on saturday that 's attracting other likely republican presidential candidates .. the wisconsin executive 's well-established intentions to compete for the oval oval next year had state democrats accusing their republican colleagues of pressing the issue to help walker 's likely presidential campaign , even though walker had said he did n't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics .. they called on walker to veto the bill .. ` it 's the workers in this state that are suffering through the politics of our governor 's ambitions , ' said democratic rep. cory mason of racine .. vos accused democrats of having ` walker derangement syndrome , ' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues .. ` i 'm not going to apologize about using the word freedom , ' said republican rep. jeremy thiesfeldt of fond du lac .. ` i 'm going to use it over and over again because that 's what this is about . '. democratic rep. latonya johnson of milwaukee , and a member of afscme , said she cares about people more than freedom .. ` it just angers me to know that we come here and we pass bills that affect people 's everyday lives and we do n't have a clue as to how those everyday people live or how they survive , ' johnson said .. ` this bill is a bunch of crap . '. the national campaign arm of state democrats , the democratic legislative campaign committee , said in a statement that ` wisconsin republicans should be ashamed of this savage attack on unions and the hard-working men and women . '. it called on wisconsin lawmakers to put aside their ` right-wing ideology aside to promote policies that actually help the state 's middle class . '. a crowd protests outside the wisconsin senate during an extraordinary session on the right-to-work bill last week .. the group much smaller than the one in 2011 against walker 's law stripping public sector unions of much of their power and 100,000 protesters camped out .. still , the largest rally attracted roughly 3,000 people. ` instead of addressing the real problems facing wisconsin , ' dlcc executive director michael sargeant said , citing a $ 2.2 billion budget deficit , ` republicans decided instead to speed the passage of legislation that lowers wages , interferes with the operations of private companies , and satisfies the demands of the right-wing special interest groups that seem to have been calling the shots in scott walker 's wisconsin since he took office . '. americans for prosperity , a conservative non-profit with chapters across the country that spent $ 7 million to defend walker after the 2011 spat with unions said friday afternoon that ` every american deserves the right to work where they please without being compelled to pay dues , just as they have the right to join a union if they choose . '. ` we 're pleased that wisconsin is once again leading the way when it comes to worker freedom , ' afp chief operating officer luke hilgemann said in a statement .. afp-wisconsin state director david fladeboe said in a secondary statement that his chapter is ` excited to see this commonsense legislation move the state forward and finally bring relief for workers who simply want to do their jobs . '. ` no longer will the badger state 's employees be compelled to join a labor union or surrender union dues as a condition of employment , ' he said and thanked the organization 's volunteers for writing letters to lawmakers , calling their offices and going door-to-door in support of the campaign .

laser beams could help detect cervical cancer at an early stage , say researchers from china .. the new technique involves firing pulses of light , more of which is absorbed by cancerous cells than by healthy tissue .. the way the cancer cells react to the light means they can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan .. the scan can show not only if someone has the disease , but also potentially how advanced it is .. the way the cancer cells react to the light from the laser beams means they can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan. more than 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the uk , with around 1,000 women dying from it .. almost all cases are caused by the human papillomavirus ( hpv ) , often spread during sex .. there are more than 100 types of hpv , many of which are harmless .. but some can disrupt the normal functioning of the cells of the cervix and can eventually trigger the growth of cancer .. cervical smear tests are used to screen for abnormal cells -- and the results may lead to a physical examination ( where the cells are examined in situ using a microscope ) and then a biopsy .. a ct or mri scan is performed only if the biopsy suggests there is cancer .. although cervical screening -- offered to all women over 25 -- has led to a large drop in the numbers affected by cervical cancer and in deaths , lesions can be missed and visual examinations can also lead to unnecessary biopsies .. the new technology , known as photoacoustic imaging , requires neither a biopsy nor a smear test .. it works on the principle that cancerous tissues ( and possibly even pre-cancerous cells ) absorbs more light than healthy tissue .. this is because of changes in cancerous tissue such as the formation of new , abnormal blood vessels and fewer collagen fibres ( a tough , connective tissue ) .. cervical smear tests are used to screen for abnormal cells -- and the results may lead to a physical examination ( where the cells are examined in situ using a microscope ) and then a biopsy. the cancerous tissue can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan because the extra energy absorbed from the light is converted into heat , which causes the cells to expand and affects the way soundwaves bounce back to the scanner , creating an image of the cells with cancerous changes .. photoacoustic imaging could also identify the stage of the disease without a biopsy , say the researchers .. this is because the more advanced the disease , the greater the amount of light and energy absorbed by the cells ; these areas then look even more pronounced on a scan .. the technique has so far been tested on tissue samples from 30 women -- some with cancer and some who were healthy -- which showed that it can distinguish between the two .. ` we have shown for the first time that photoacoustic imaging has the potential to make better diagnoses and help save lives , ' say the researchers from central south university , china .. the study is published in biomedical optics express , the journal of the optical society of america .. the same technology is also being investigated for detecting and monitoring other cancers , including breast and skin .. fiona osgun , cancer research uk 's health information officer , said : ` this small study is at a very early stage and we are a long way from knowing if this technique could diagnose cervical cancer .. cervical screening is the best way to detect cervical changes early before they develop into cancer . '. meanwhile , a special red‑light laser could banish bad breath .. halitosis is typically caused by bacteria in the mouth which produce unpleasant smelling chemicals as they break down food .. a team of researchers from the university nove de julho in brazil found that low-level laser light , which can kill bacteria , cut levels of bad breath-causing chemicals by around a third in 60 minutes .. the light is used in conjunction with a special light-sensitive dye on a patient 's tongue , in order to target the bacteria-killing effects of the laser .

" you 're so beautiful , " empire , and here are some of the reasons why :. henson has been in the industry for a minute , and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like " hustle & flow " and " the curious case of benjamin button " ( the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress oscar nomination ) , her career had n't really taken off .. henson has sunk her teeth into the role of lyon family matriarch cookie .. the character is hard-core and street smart and loves her family fiercely , even as she is also motivated by making money .. the show 's co-creator , danny strong , told entertainment weekly that fans can thank henson for the now infamous " boo boo kitty " nickname that viewers have come to love .. when cookie sneeringly calls her ex-husband lucious ' new lady love , anika calhoun ( played by grace gealey ) , " boo boo kitty , " you want to yell at the screen , " get her , cookie ! ". " so , basically taraji is a genius , " strong said .. " she 's a comic genius , but she 's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress , and we 're utilizing all that in cookie . ". watch for henson to snag nominations next award season .. think " dynasty " and " dallas " for the 21st century .. it has all the things that make prime-time soaps so delicious : sex , scores to settle , family tensions , violence and did we mention sex ?. set in the world of the music industry , there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy , dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode .. that 's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that " and then what ? ". " empire " has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern .. one of the primary story lines has been about homophobia , as lucious lyon and his son jamal ( jussie smollett ) battle over jamal revealing he 's gay .. it comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights .. series co-creator lee daniels , himself an openly gay man , has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community .. " homophobia is rampant in the african-american community , and men are on the dl ( down low , meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women ) .. they do n't come out , because your priest says , your pastor says , mama says , your next-door neighbor says , your homie says , your brother says , your boss says ( that homosexuality is wrong ) , " the wrap reported daniels saying during the television critics association press tour in january .. " and they are killing african-american women .. they are killing our women .. so i wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community . ". the music is off the hook. the show has managed to improve on what " glee " did and succeed at what the now-canceled nbc drama " smash " tried to do : fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry .. smollett has been the breakout star in this area .. his mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack 's more popular tunes , including the anthem to individuality , " good enough , " which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service spotify .. superproducer timbaland ( best known for work with artists including jay z and justin timberlake ) and his protegee jim beanz are responsible for the show 's sound .. beanz told rolling stone the music has to be authentic and original .. " one of the things that tim told me is , ` if it sounds like something you 've heard before , do n't do it , ' " he said .. of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on itunes .. fingers crossed for a possible " empire " tour featuring smollett and other co-stars including bryshere y. gray , who portrays youngest lyon son hakeem and who in real life raps under the moniker yazz the greatest .. you could have knocked us over with a feather when courtney love popped up on the show .. love had a bit role on this first season , as has supermodel naomi campbell and '80s actor judd nelson .. the series has been hyping appearances from music stars like jennifer hudson , mary j. blige and patti labelle .. given the popularity of the show , there 's no telling who will pop up on season 2 .. the love/hate relationship between cookie and lucious lyon is everything .. they have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite .. chalk it up to the longtime friendship between henson and howard , who also co-starred in the film " hustle and flow . ". howard told blacktree tv that he and henson had to do a " chemistry read " to show that they clicked .. the end result has been magical .. " we have so much fun , " howard said .
the last salmon fisherman on the river severn is embroiled in a legal battle with the environment agency - after catching just a single fish too many .. nigel mott , 71 , has been catching salmon in traditional basket traps since the 1970s and once netted up to 600 fish a year worth # 100 each .. but his livelihood was thrown into doubt in 2012 when the environment agency ruled that no individual fisherman could land more than 30 in a season .. nigel mott is the last remaining commercial salmon fisherman on the river severn and claims it is impossible for him to make a living if he is restricted to catching just 30 fish in a season. nigel 's home in stroat , gloucestershire , is around six miles from the town of lydney , off which he fishes .. the 71-year-old used to catch up to 600 salmon a year worth # 100 each. defiant nigel continued to use his putcher rank - an array of 650 basket-like traps - and hit the quota in just 26 days .. as a protest he presented his 31st fish to the local environment agency office - and was duly prosecuted .. he won his case but the agency has now announced plans to appeal the decision .. nigel said : ` when i caught the 30th fish , i rang them up and told them i was going to fish in excess of the 30 - i even brought them my 31st fish .. ` they seized my fish and warned me of a prosecution - which is exactly what i wanted because i was very anxious to get my evidence before a court . '. the environment agency introduced the new quotas amid fears that the salmon population in the severn was dangerously low .. nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , has won his case , but must face another hearing in the court of appeal. after catching his 31st fish nigel was prosecuted for breaching his licence and the case was heard at the high court in london in february .. nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , argued that the unreasonably low quota threatened his livelihood and would put him out of business .. he claims his form of fishing has minimal impact on salmon in the severn , as his putchers stretch out just a couple of hundred metres from the riverbank .. that leaves a mile of open water for the fish to swim past his cages , he argued , allowing plenty of space .. despite winning the case his legal battle still shows no signs of ending as the environment agency has vowed to take it to the court of appeal .. a spokesman said : ` although the judge has at this stage ruled in mr mott 's favour , we will be seeking leave to appeal to the court of appeal .. ` all of these sites are designated to protect salmon , and these populations are currently under threat .. ` we impose restrictions on salmon fishing for all fisheries in these areas because of the need to protect the designated habitats and fisheries .

former barcelona manager gerrardo martino believes lionel messi is a dream player to work with because he can play in almost any attacking position .. messi famously played in the ` false nine ' spot for four years at barcelona when pep guardiola , who now manages bayern munich , was in control of the catalan club .. the argentinian has taken up the no 10 role under manager luis enrique on occasions this season , but has also been deployed in wider roles to form a three-pronged attack with luis suarez and neymar .. lionel messi weighs up his options with barcelona teammate neymar during the game with manchester city. messi celebrates after scoring during the la liga match between eibar and barcelona at the ipurua stadium. martino , who is a coach for argentina , knows all about the 27-year-old having worked with both on the international and domestic scene and admits messi is effective in almost every attacking role .. ` for a long time we have n't seen him be as absolutely crucial as he was against manchester city on wednesday , ' the coach told mundo deportivo .. ` he can play on the right , left , as a no. 9 , behind the striker , or even as a no. 4 !. he is able to make the difference anywhere on the pitch .

liverpool defender martin skrtel insists he does not feel guilty about the challenge on manchester united goalkeeper david de gea which resulted in his three-match ban .. the slovakia international , currently away preparing for a euro 2016 qualifier at home to luxembourg on friday , failed in his appeal against a violent conduct charge .. skrtel had argued the action of standing on de gea 's right shin as he chased a through-ball in the final seconds of sunday 's 2-1 defeat at anfield was unintentional but an independent panel disagreed with him .. martin skrtel 's foot lands on david de gea 's leg in the incident which saw the fa charge the defender. a three-man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it was missed by martin atkinson ( right ). skrtel could have been in more trouble for posting this picture of clowns after the fa upheld his ban. the 30-year-old has continued to profess his innocence even after his ban was confirmed , meaning he misses premier league matches against arsenal and newcastle , plus an fa cup quarter-final replay at blackburn .. ` it feels strange because we appealed against those charges and still i was hit by a three-match ban , ' he told his personal website martin-skrtel .. i did n't want to stamp on him .. it was an accident and i did n't do it on purpose .. i do n't feel guilty .. it was a long ball and he went towards me and i wanted to jump over him .. the defender is unlikely to punished after he posted a picture of clowns on his instagram account on wednesday - which has been widely viewed as his comment on those who sat on the panel and decided the outcome of the hearing .. steven gerrard will also miss three games after seeing red for this stamp during the 2-1 defeat. captain gerrard was sent off after stamping on manchester united 's ander herrera on sunday. skrtel will be joined on the sidelines by liverpool captain steven gerrard , who will also serve a similar three-match ban after his moment of madness saw him sent off less than a minute after coming on as a substitute for the second half after stamping on united midfielder ander herrera .. with skrtel and several of his team-mates away on international duty the club 's under 21 squad have been invited to train at the first-team 's melwood base .. however , one of their number jordan lussey will be getting competitive action elsewhere after completed a loan move to bolton , currently 17th in the sky bet championship .. the 20-year-old follows the likes of sheyi ojo and jerome sinclair , who have both joined relegation-threatened championship side wigan on loan in the last six weeks to gain first-team football experience .
( cnn ) computer hacking was once the realm of curious teenagers .. it 's now the arena of government spies , professional thieves and soldiers of fortune .. today , it 's all about the money .. that 's why chinese hackers broke into lockheed martin and stole the blueprints to the trillion-dollar f-35 fighter jet .. it 's also why russian hackers have sneaked into western oil and gas companies for years .. the stakes are higher , too .. in 2010 , hackers slipped a " digital bomb " into the nasdaq that nearly sabotaged the stock market .. in 2012 , iran ruined 30,000 computers at saudi oil producer aramco .. and think of the immense ( and yet undisclosed ) damage from north korea 's cyberattack on sony pictures last year .. computers were destroyed , executives ' embarrassing emails were exposed , and the entire movie studio was thrown into chaos .. it was n't always this way .. hacking actually has some pretty innocent and harmless beginnings .. the whole concept of " hacking " sprouted from the massachusetts institute of technology nearly 50 years ago .. computer science students there borrowed the term from a group of model train enthusiasts who " hacked " electric train tracks and switches in 1969 to improve performance .. these new hackers were already figuring out how to alter computer software and hardware to speed it up , even as the scientists at at&t bell labs were developing unix , one of the world 's first major operating systems .. hacking became the art of figuring out unique solutions .. it takes an insatiable curiosity about how things work ; hackers wanted to make technology work better , or differently .. they were not inherently good or bad , just clever .. in that sense , the first generation of true hackers were " phreakers , " a bunch of american punks who toyed with the nation 's telephone system .. in 1971 , they discovered that if you whistle at a certain high-pitched tone , 2600-hertz , you could access at&t 's long-distance switching system .. they would make international phone calls , just for the fun of it , to explore how the telephone network was set up .. the most famous phreaker , john draper ( aka " cap'n crunch ) earned his nickname because he realized the toy whistle given away in cereal boxes emitted just the right tone .. this trained engineer took that concept to the next level by building a custom " blue box " to make those free calls .. this surreptitious little box was such a novel idea that young engineers steve wozniak and steve jobs started building and selling it themselves .. these are the guys who would later go on to start apple .. wire fraud spiked , and the fbi cracked down on phreakers and their blue boxes .. the laws did n't quite fit , though .. kids were charged with making harassing phone calls and the like .. but federal agents could n't halt this phenomenon .. a tech-savvy , inquisitive and slightly anti-authoritarian community had been born .. the next generation came in the early 1980s , as people bought personal computers for their homes and hooked them up to the telephone network .. the web was n't yet alive , but computers could still talk to one another .. this was the golden age of hacking .. these curious kids tapped into whatever computer system they could find just to explore .. some broke into computer networks at companies .. others told printers at hospitals hundreds of miles away to just spit out paper .. and the first digital hangouts came into being .. hackers met on text-only bulletin board systems to talk about phreaking , share computer passwords and tips .. the 1983 movie " war games " depicted this very thing , only the implications were disastrous .. in it , a teenager in washington state accidentally taps into a military computer and nearly brings the world to nuclear war .. it 's no surprise , then , that the fbi was on high alert that year , and arrested six teenagers in milwaukee -- who called themselves the 414s , after their area code -- when they tapped into the los alamos national laboratory , a nuclear weapon research facility .. nationwide fears led the u.s. congress to pass the computer fraud and abuse act in 1986 .. breaking into computer systems was now a crime of its own .. the damage of hacking started getting more serious , too .. in 1988 , the government 's arpanet , the earliest version of the internet , got jammed when a cornell university graduate student , curious about the network 's size , created a self-replicating software worm that multiplied too quickly .. the next year , a few german hackers working for the russian kgb were caught breaking into the pentagon .. in 1990 , hacker kevin poulsen rigged a los angeles radio station 's phone system to win a porsche , only to be arrested afterward .. the cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and hackers continued throughout the 1990s .. russian mathematician vladimir levin was caught stealing $ 10 million from citibank .. others did it for revenge .. tim lloyd wiped the computers at omega engineering in new jersey after he was fired .. but hacks were still more of an annoyance than anything devastating , though it was quickly becoming apparent that the potential was there .. the stock market , hospitals , credit card transactions -- everything was running on computers now .. there was a bone-chilling moment when a ragtag group of hackers calling themselves l0pht testified before congress in 1998 and said they could shut down the internet in 30 minutes .. the danger was suddenly more real than ever .. the ethos was starting to change , too .. previously , hackers broke into computers and networks because they were curious and those tools were inaccessible .. the web changed that , putting all that stuff at everyone 's fingertips .. money became the driving force behind hacks , said c. thomas , a member of l0pht who is known internationally as the hacker " space rogue . ". an unpatched bug in windows could let a hacker enter a bank , or a foreign government office .. mafias and governments were willing to pay top dollar for this entry point .. a totally different kind of black market started to grow .. the best proof came in 2003 , when microsoft started offering a $ 5 million bounty on hackers attacking windows .. " it 's no longer a quest for information and knowledge by exploring networks .. it 's about dollars , " thomas said .. " researchers are no longer motivated to get stuff fixed .. now , they say , ` i 'm going to go looking for bugs to get a paycheck - and sell this bug to a government . ' ". loosely affiliated amateurs were replaced by well-paid , trained professionals .. by the mid-2000s , hacking belonged to organized crime , governments and hacktivists .. first , crime : hackers around the world wrote malicious software ( malware ) to hijack tens of thousands of computers , using their processing power to generate spam .. they wrote banking trojans to steal website login credentials .. hacking payment systems turned out to be insanely lucrative , too .. albert gonzalez 's theft of 94 million credit cards from the company tjx in 2007 proved to be a precursor to later retailer data breaches , like target , home depot and many more .. when the united states wanted to sabotage the iranian nuclear program in 2009 , it hacked a development facility and unleashed the most dangerous computer virus the world has ever seen .. stuxnet caused the iranian lab computers to spin centrifuges out of control .. this was unprecedented : a digital strike with extreme physical consequences .. similarly , there 's proof that russia used hackers to coordinate its attack on georgia during a five-day war in 2008 , taking out key news and government websites as tanks rolled into those specific cities .. the populist group anonymous hacks into police departments to expose officer brutality and floods banks with garbage internet traffic .. a vigilante known as " the jester " takes down islamic jihadist websites .. what exists now is a tricky world .. the white house gets hacked .. was it the russian government or russian nationalists acting on their own ?. or freelance agents paid by the government ?. in the digital realm , attribution is extremely difficult .. meanwhile , it 's easier than ever to become a hacker .. digital weapons go for mere dollars on easily accessible black markets online .. anonymity is a few clicks away with the right software .. and there are high-paying jobs in defending companies like google or jpmorgan chase -- or attacking them .. as a result , law enforcement tolerance for hacking has fallen to zero .. in 1999 , the hacker space rogue exposed how fao schwarz 's website was leaking consumer email addresses and forced the company to fix it .. when andrew auernheimer ( known as " weev " ) did the same thing to at&t in 2010 , he spent more than a year in prison until his case was overturned on a technicality .. the days of mere curiosity are over .
unless manchester city can produce the greatest result in their european history - arguably their entire history - and overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against barcelona on wednesday night , england faces an embarrassing total wipeout from this season 's champions league .. with paris saint-germain dumping chelsea out last week and monaco resisting arsenal 's spirited fightback on tuesday night , we face the prospect of having no premier league representatives in the quarter-finals .. the english charge on the continent halted by mid-march ?. it never used to be like this , you know .. arsenal 's santi cazorla is commiserated as monaco celebrate knocking out the english side on tuesday. dejected chelsea players walk off the field at stamford bridge after their champions league exit to psg. joe hart roars his frustration during manchester city 's first-leg defeat to barcelona at the etihad. this graphic showing the english clubs that have reached the champions league quarter-finals since 2004. you do n't have to flick too far back through the record books to find a time when england ruled in europe 's foremost club competition .. the last halcyon days were the three seasons from 2006-07 until the end of 2008-09 , when the premier league supplied 11 of the 24 quarter-finalists .. going back to liverpool 's miraculous triumph in istanbul in 2005 , england has provided eight of the 20 finalists .. in the 2006-07 season , liverpool , chelsea and manchester united all made it to the semi-finals .. they all repeated the feat 12 months later , with united beating chelsea on penalties in the moscow final .. in 2008-09 , united knocked out arsenal in the last four , while barcelona squeezed past chelsea .. since then , it 's been an overall trend of decline .. while united were runners-up again in 2011 and chelsea lifted the trophy in 2012 , as well as reaching the semi-finals last season , the english dominance seen during that golden three-year period has n't been replicated .. chelsea and manchester united contested the 2008 champions league final in a golden period for england. man united met arsenal in the champions league semi-finals in the 2008-09 campaign. chelsea and liverpool met in the 2008 champions league semi-finals , with the london club advancing. the mantle has been passed to spain , who will expect to see barcelona , real madrid and atletico madrid in the last four unless paired in the next round .. so while the premier league continues to grow ever-richer , with the astonishing # 5.1 bn television deal signed earlier this year ensuring record returns for years to come , money does n't necessarily guarantee success across the board in europe .. though chelsea reached the last four a year ago , united exited at the quarter-final stage , while city and arsenal departed in the last 16 .. the season 2012-13 was even worse , with united and arsenal crashing out in the last 16 and chelsea and city failing to get out of their groups .. there is n't one single reason to explain this slump in premier league performance , but a growing school of thought is that the lack of a winter break is beginning to hold our teams back .. sir alex ferguson , arsene wenger and jose mourinho have always advocated a winter pause and the evidence to support them grows with every passing season .. wayne rooney and manchester united were beaten by bayern munich in last season 's quarter-finals. lionel messi scores for barcelona in their win over manchester city this time last season. tomas rosicky and arsenal were eliminated by bayern munich at the last-16 stage last season. city boss manuel pellegrini joined the chorus in an interview with sportsmail this week , saying : ` december and january are very tough months because of the number of games .. ` you reach an important part of the season and you are not in optimum shape because there is no winter break as there is in other countries .. ` english football gives other leagues an advantage .. there are some traditions you ca n't change , i realise that .. but you ca n't play nine games in december and nine in january .. you have to stop at some point . '. the quantity and intensity of fixtures in england means that no player can emerge from the hectic december and january period firing on all cylinders .. it is a time that features vital matches in the premier league as the title race takes shape , while the leading clubs are increasingly keen to win the fa cup and league cup , which might at one time have warranted weakened teams .. the leading sides are scared witless of finishing the season empty-handed - even the once-maligned league cup is now taken seriously .. man city manager manuel pellegrini has joined the chorus of managers favouring a winter break. paris saint-germain did n't play a competitive match between december 21 and january 4. chelsea played five times during that period , including a 5-3 defeat at tottenham on new year 's day. in explaining chelsea 's exit , you might consider that psg did n't play a single competitive match between december 21 and january 4 .. in that same time , chelsea played stoke city , west ham , southampton , tottenham and watford .. while monaco broke off after winning at metz on december 20 and did n't resume until january 4 , arsenal had to play liverpool , qpr , west ham , southampton and hull city .. for both london clubs , the fixtures continued to come thick and fast in the subsequent six weeks before their european ties .. and while manchester city played crystal palace , west brom , burnley , sunderland and sheffield wednesday , barcelona were out of action .. after cruising into the winter break with an 8-1 rout of huesca and a 5-0 win over cordoba , when they resumed , lionel messi and co - after a shock defeat by real sociedad - recorded thrashings of elche ( 5-0 , 4-0 and 6-0 ) and deportivo la coruna ( 4-0 ) .. there is no escaping the reality that barcelona 's matches are far more straightforward than those played by city .. little wonder they had the greater energy at the etihad .. barcelona had not only a winter break but a reasonably straightforward run of games in january. while football over the christmas period should be kept sacred , a couple of weeks off in january would not go amiss and would boost english chances of getting through the last-16 stage .. the scrapping of fa cup replays would also be a sensible move .. of course , there was no winter break in england between 2006 and 2009 , but english clubs still prospered .. this points perhaps to a growing pace and intensity of all domestic games and perhaps a strategic naivety in approaching two-legged ties .. owen hargreaves , well-placed to compare styles having played for bayern munich and united , observed on bt sport last week that : ` if we got past the first 20 or 30 minutes , we 'd probably win the game because the english teams used to come out all guns blazing , the defence would push the team forward and we used to realise if we could keep it at 0-0 we would win .. ` in the premier league , that works , but in europe the teams are too talented , too good in possession . '. should city exit , as expected , against barcelona , the debate as to why english clubs no longer reach the latter stages of the champions league en masse will intensify .. there is no definitive answer or quick fix but a breather in english football 's ruthless , relentless schedule is an increasingly popular option to give our teams a fighting chance in europe .

so the luxury condo she lived in along with the purple mercedes all made sense to cady .. and when she was struggling financially , lee offered her a job as personal assistant , as she needed the help while 'em barking on a new business venture ' .. while lee was vague on the details , cady took the job with her first assignment pretending to be a wealthy diva who was particular about the way her luggage was loaded onto the plane at the van nuys airport in california .. cady learned later that she was risking arrest for lee who feared it , as she was sent on the drug-smuggling flight in her place .. but on her fourth flight , when cady ( above ) complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin , she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation. but she nearly made a fatal mistake after offering to help with the suitcases on her second flight , which she was scolded for by lee .. this along with other jobs including making large wire transfers under her own name left her confused about her role as lee 's personal assistant .. on her fourth flight , when she complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin , she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation .. in the book , which is out on march 24 , cady revealed that even though the truth came out , she remained silent and was arrested along with lee in columbus by federal agents in 2010 .. in the end , during the trial , cady learned the truth - lee had been fostered as a small child , and was the illegitimate daughter of a samsung heiress and a japanese father who owned casinos .. film director craig brewer , a sundance winner for 2005 film hustle and flow , is considering making a movie based on lee 's life .

toy giant lego has come under fire from parents after publishing an article in its own-brand magazine which offered a range of ` insulting ' beauty tips to young girls .. the march/april edition of the lego club magazine included a feature called 'em ma 's beauty tips ' , which suggested that young girls who are ` ready to change up their looks ' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape .. ` you , yes you , are beautiful , but if you 're ready to change up your look , read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face , ' the article reads .. outrage : this ` beauty tips ' feature in the march/april edition of the lego club magazine has caused fury among parents. the feature then lists five different face shapes , from ` heart faces ' to ` oval faces ' , suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape .. and while those with heart-shaped faces are advised to choose ` long , curly layers and thinned out curls ' in order to accentuate their ` angular cheeks ' , those with oval faces are told that they are lucky enough to be able to ` have almost any style haircut ' because ` almost everything looks great on this face shape ' .. unsurprisingly , the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother , cleveland-based writer sharon holbrook , writing a piece for the new york times slamming the magazine 's ` insulting ' feature . '. [ my daughter ] is seven , ' she wrote .. ` my little girl , the shape of her face , and whether her haircut is flattering are none of lego 's concern , ' it was n't even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it . '. mrs holbrook goes on to quote from the lego friends website , which states that the range is aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 who are , she writes , ` far too young ' to be told that their face shape might mean they need a new haircut in order to ` soften the edges ' of their faces .. unnecessary : the ` overtly girly ' lego friends line , including this heartlake hair salon , has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional lego models. calling for change : writer sharon holbrook ( pictured ) wrote a piece about the lego feature in which she insisted that children as young as five should not be worrying about whether they have a flattering face shape. the online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media , with parents across the country calling for lego to abandon its ` sexist ' marketing campaigns and ` overtly girly ' toy ranges in favor of returning to the ` powerful messages ' it once offered to young girls who were so eager to play with their products .. ` go back to this [ message ] of 1981 instead of " beauty tips for 5-12 year-olds " c ** p , ' one person wrote on twitter , alongside a picture of a 30-year-old lego ad campaign which encouraged young girls to ` build for fun ' .. another added : ` nonononono .. girls do n't need another source of beauty tips , let alone from you . '. one parent went as far as to say she would boycott lego until the brand does something to address its ` sexist ' campaigns , tweeting : ` hey @lego_group , your sexism is getting out of control .. i 'm buying @tegu blocks until you check it ( sic ) . '. ` the ultra-girly lego friends line caused a flap from the beginning , and i was n't at all sure whether i liked it , ' mrs holbrook added .. ` why ca n't girls and boys both play with traditional legos ?. when i was little , lego used to even market them to all children , magnificently so ... '. go back : parents are calling for lego to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls , such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981. fury : many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly ` sexist ' lego friends line. in a statement provided to mashable , lego spokesman michael mcnally insisted that the copmany was taking onboard all of the feedback offered by ` readers ' , adding that the brand ` sincerely regrets ' any offense caused by the feature .. ` our club team is always striving for new ways to engage with lego fans based on insights we gather from our club audience , ' mr mcnally said .. ` one particular thing that readers asked us to include was an " advice column " .. in the most recent magazine , we attempted to deliver against this request by elaborating on a current lego friends story line .. ` we sincerely regret any disappointment it may have caused .. we value this feedback and have already shared with the lego club team in order to positively impact future stories . '. it is not the first time that the lego friends line , the range of toys on which the beauty tips article was based , has come under heavy criticism from parents .. shortly after the range debuted in 2011 , many people spoke out to express concern about its seemingly sexist suggestion that young girls needed their own line of feminine toys , rather than being able to play with the traditional building blocks also used by boys .. instead of the more conventional themes many associate with lego blocks , the lego friends line focuses on shopping , beauty products , homemaking and cooking .
technology that might have averted the germanwings tragedy by remotely seizing control of the plane has existed for years -- but has been resisted by the aviation industry , it emerged last night. support for real-time monitoring of jets from the ground has stalled amid airline fears of the dangers of eliminating pilots and the possibilities of a so-called cyber-hijack by terrorists .. unions representing pilots are also against the move .. the 9/11 attacks on the us , in which terrorists used hijacked aircraft as weapons , sparked calls for new systems to prevent a repeat of the atrocity .. recovery : teams working in the difficult alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings. grief : relatives of the victims overcome with emotion after attending a tribute in honour of their loved ones in le vernet , france on thursday. philip baum , editor of aviation security international , said the tragedy was partly due to ` knee-jerk ' controls introduced after 9/11 .. he told the independent : ` the ill-thought reinforced cockpit door has had catastrophic consequences . '. mr baum said thinking about airline safety had been skewed by the 2001 terror attacks , adding that there had been ` excessive attention given to terrorism ' and a ` failure to address other threats to aviation security ' .. manufacturers in europe and america have worked on ways of creating a ` hijack-proof ' aircraft .. in 2006 , boeing was awarded a us patent for an ` uninterruptible autopilot system ' .. this would allow pilots , ground controllers or security agencies such as the cia to activate an automatic flight mode that can not be turned off by anyone on board .. the system could also switch itself on if terrorists tried to fight their way into the cockpit , with pressure sensors on the door responding to excessive force .. eight previous crashes have been caused by suspected pilot suicide , leading to 416 deaths .. november 29 , 2013 : mozambique airlines flight 470 crashed in namibia , killing 33 people .. october 31 , 1999 : 217 people died after egypt air flight 990 from new york crash-landed in the sea .. october 11 , 1999 : an air botswana pilot grounded for medical reasons took off and crashed his plane .. he was the only fatality .. december 19 , 1997 : 104 people were killed when silk air flight 185 crashed in indonesia .. august 21 , 1994 : a royal air maroc pilot flew into the atlas mountains , killing 44 people .. july 13 , 1994 : a russian air force engineer crashed a plane he stole at a military base , killing himself .. august 22 , 1979 : a recently sacked mechanic crashed a stolen plane in colombia , killing four .. september 26 , 1976 : twelve died when a russian pilot directed his plane at his ex-wife 's flat .. the aircraft 's flight path could be radioed to it by ground control , and it would be brought safely down at a nearby airport using existing automatic landing aids .. sources at boeing claimed at the time that the anti-hijack equipment could be fitted to planes all over the world by 2010 .. but this has failed to happen amid safety concerns from pilots and airlines , and the technology remains unproven .. the ability to direct pilotless aircraft from the ground is well established -- military drones have long been used for surveillance and targeted missile attacks .. in 2013 , a 16-seater jetstream airliner became the first passenger plane to fly ` unmanned ' across uk civilian airspace .. it was controlled remotely from the ground for the 500-mile journey , though a pilot on board handled the take-off and landing .. but the idea of flying a plane carrying hundreds of passengers without any human intervention continues to worry experts .. britain 's civil aviation authority said there was no remote control system currently available that could cope with navigating the country 's crowded skies .. a spokesman added : ` there are companies working on it , but the technology does n't exist in a practical or useable form yet . '. pilots ' union balpa fears using pilotless planes or allowing authorities to remotely take control of a stricken or hijacked aircraft -- and believes it could leave planes in danger of being ` hacked ' from afar .. a spokesman said : ` having at least two pilots on the flight deck has helped make flying an incredibly safe form of public transport .. the focus in the wake of this tragic accident is likely to be on ensuring that both pilots always have access to the cockpit and can not be prevented from re-entering .. ` with this and any other measures we must act with careful consideration to ensure we do n't create new safety risks or concerns such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft . '. aviation safety analyst chris yates said there had been frequent calls for remote-controlled aircraft takeover systems since 9/11 .. but he also argued that this could pose more risks to passengers , with ground controllers unable to see all that a pilot on board could see .. there is also a danger the technology would allow cyber-terrorists to hack into an airliner 's controls .. mr yates added : ` there has always been a desire to have the ability to control planes from the ground ... but the ground element of that was entirely pooh-poohed by the aviation industry for a whole variety of reasons , not least of which is aircraft safety .. ` questions will always be posed as to whether pilots should be taken out of the equation in the event of something like this so ground control would take over ... i personally would not feel comfortable getting on any airliner where control could be taken away from the pilots and co-pilots . '. youngest victim : seven-month-old julian pracz-bandres , pictured with his mother marina bandres ( also right ) , died when the airbus crashed. 9/11 rules allowed tragedy to happen. the disaster was made possible because of rules introduced after the 9/11 attacks to keep hijackers out of aircraft cockpits .. here sam marsden and ray massey analyse how co-pilot andreas lubitz took advantage of his colleague 's toilet break to crash the plane. when are pilots allowed to leave the cockpit ?. the days when aircraft captains wandered through the cabin chatting to air hostesses and children are long gone .. in general both pilots must remain in their positions at the controls of at all times , and on short-haul flights they generally do not budge .. but once the jet is safely in the air , they can get up to use the toilet as long as they are not absent any longer than is necessary .. patrick sonderheimer , the pilot of the germanwings plane , waited to reach cruising altitude before stepping out of the cockpit , pictured. patrick sonderheimer , the pilot of the germanwings plane , waited to reach cruising altitude at 38,000 ft before stepping out of the cockpit .. why was lubitz allowed to remain on the flight deck on his own ?. it is considered best practice to ensure that there are always two people in the cockpit to avoid tragedies like tuesday 's .. a relief pilot travels on some long-haul flights so the other crew members can get some sleep .. access to the cockpit door on the germanwings airbus a320 ( like the one above ) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking. many airlines have a rule that another crew member must replace the pilot or co-pilot while they go to the toilet .. but , in line with german aviation authority requirements , germanwings did not stipulate that a pilot could not be left alone in the cockpit .. britain 's civil aviation authority yesterday changed its guidance in light of this week 's disaster and now urges uk airlines to enforce the two-person rule .. several european airlines , including easyjet , have announced that they will now insist that two crew remain in the cockpit at all times .. why was the pilot unable to get back into the cockpit ?. the black box voice recorder recovered from the wreckage reveals that mr sonderheimer first knocked gently on the door seeking to get back in after his brief toilet trip .. as the minutes passed and he realised his crazed co-pilot was steering all 150 people on board to their deaths , he became increasingly desperate and attempted to smash the door down .. but lubitz was able to barricade himself inside the cockpit thanks to an armoured bullet-proof door designed to protect passengers by keeping out terrorists .. these were made mandatory after the 9/11 terror attacks on the us .. to save weight , the reinforced cockpit doors often contain bullet-proof kevlar and other super-strong composite compounds , as well as metal .. the airbus a320 has a keypad outside the cockpit which allows cabin crew to gain access by tapping in a secret code if the pilots become incapacitated for some reason .. but the pilot can flick a switch to lock the door from the inside , which deactivates the external keypad for between five and 20 minutes .. what screening did lubitz undergo before being allowed to fly ?. top airlines use psychological testing to check that would-be pilots are able to cope with stressful situations as well as possessing the skills needed to fly a large aircraft .. anyone found to have a history of alcohol or drug addiction or a serious mental health problem faces being rejected .. flight crew have regular medical check-ups .. those under 40 are examined once a year , while older pilots undergo tests every six months .. doctors look for health issues , including signs of stress , fatigue , drug or alcohol abuse that may point to deeper psychological problems .. without their medical certificate pilots are not allowed to fly .. aviation psychologist professor robert bor said : ` every time they arrive at an airport they have to check-in and meet with other staff -- to not spot a pilot with mental health problems would be rare . '. lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , said its air crew were chosen extremely carefully and subjected to psychological vetting .
( cnn ) in washington 's polarized political environment , support for israel has been a rare area of bipartisan cooperation -- at least until now .. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's speech to congress on tuesday threatens to undermine the nearly 67-year tradition of bipartisan support that has endured since president harry truman became the first head of state to recognize israel .. netanyahu is driven not only by his concerns about iran 's nuclear threat -- the topic of his address -- but also by domestic political considerations .. israel will hold its national elections just two weeks after his visit to washington .. netanyahu is fighting for his political life as he faces a tougher than expected re-election campaign .. he has been widely blamed at home for having failed to lower the high cost of living , an issue that his rivals have eagerly exploited .. netanyahu has tried to offset some of this criticism by focusing on his perennial issue : iran .. a major televised address in washington concerning iran 's threat , interrupted only by standing ovations from american lawmakers , has the potential to be far more effective than any campaign ad in projecting gravitas , reinforcing his security credentials and reminding voters of his vast experience -- in contrast to his rivals ' inexperience -- in foreign affairs .. yet netanyahu 's speech , while possibly giving him a short-term boost at home , will harm jerusalem 's relations with washington , not iran 's nuclear program .. speaker john boehner 's late-january invitation to netanyahu to address a joint session of congress was coordinated with neither the white house nor the state department .. it was , in essence , a political ploy aimed at undermining president obama as he strives to reach a historic deal over iran 's nuclear program .. in defiance of the obama administration , and rejecting advice from leading figures in israel and key supporters of israel in the united states , netanyahu accepted the invitation .. by antagonizing the white house , boehner and netanyahu have put democratic members of congress in a bind , forcing them to choose between two unenviable options : either attend the speech out of respect for a close ally , but in so doing flout the president -- their party leader -- or demonstrate loyalty to obama by snubbing the leader of a major u.s. ally .. two senior senate democrats with sterling pro-israel credentials , richard durbin and dianne feinstein , tried to diffuse this latest crisis between washington and jerusalem by offering to meet with the israeli premier behind closed doors but were rebuffed by netanyahu .. feinstein had previously noted that an invitation to address congress during the israeli election period was " highly inappropriate . ". in politicizing his visit to washington , netanyahu has allowed his bad blood with obama to spill over into his government 's increasingly complicated relationship with the democratic party .. netanyahu no doubt believes that obama is misguided about the pending deal with iran .. indeed , there are good reasons to be skeptical of any agreement with a regime that has long engaged in deception and concealment with respect to its nuclear program .. less than two weeks ago , the international atomic energy agency reported that iran was continuing to evade questions about evidence of past work on designing nuclear weapons .. yet netanyahu 's move is counterproductive .. democrats on capitol hill who were inclined to support additional sanctions on iran now feel compelled to back the president .. in a rare move , five former israeli ambassadors have publicly called on netanyahu to cancel his speech .. former mossad chief meir dagan has accused netanyahu of having caused israel " heavy strategic damage on the iranian issue " by antagonizing the administration .. netanyahu 's foray into partisan politics is hardly a new phenomenon .. he has never hid his preference for the republican party .. during his first term in office , netanyahu irked president bill clinton by meeting with the rev. jerry falwell , then-house speaker newt gingrich and other detractors of the president a day before coming to the white house .. a key netanyahu supporter is u.s. casino magnate sheldon adelson , a major republican donor who also owns the pro-netanyahu newspaper israel hayom .. during the 2012 presidential campaign , adelson poured millions into republican challenger mitt romney 's coffers , saying he was willing to spend $ 100 million to defeat obama .. that july , netanyahu 's senior adviser , ron dermer , helped orchestrate romney 's visit to israel in what amounted to an implicit endorsement of obama 's rival .. dermer , a former u.s. citizen who once worked for republican pollster and political consultant frank luntz , is israel 's current ambassador to the united states .. it is dermer who coordinated the invitation to netanyahu with boehner but never mentioned the invitation to secretary of state john kerry when they met a day before boehner 's announcement .. this time , netanyahu may have gone too far .. national security adviser susan rice did not mince words when she called netanyahu 's latest move " destructive to the fabric of the relationship " between the united states and israel .. although the u.s.-israel relationship is strong and resilient , rooted in common values and shared interests , netanyahu is subjecting it to an unnecessary test with unknown consequences by choosing to play partisan politics .
more than 300 former students of a prestigious high school have signed an open letter demanding that an invitation for federal cabinet minister scott morrison to speak at a fundraising event is withdrawn .. published in full on the blog of former student danny yau , the petition is addressed to sydney boys high school 's old boys union which is asked to ` immediately rescind the invitation so as to spare the organisation , and the school itself , the embarrassment of being seen to celebrate the achievements of a man who has so flagrantly disregarded human rights ' .. the former immigration minister is scheduled to attend the cocktail fundraiser on april 15 as a guest speaker .. over 300 former students of the prestigious sydney boys high school have demanded for scott morrison 's invitation to speak at the school 's fundraiser be withdrawn. he and a number of other former students will present speeches which reflect on ` how their lives were shaped by their experiences at sydney boys high school , ' the invitation reads .. it adds that the $ 75 ticket fee will ` go towards the construction of the governors ' centre and to support the on-going activities of the old boys union ' .. however mr morrison 's possible attendance has enraged some former students of the school who deplore his role in advocating australia 's detention centres .. ` in his capacity as minister for immigration and border protection , morrison was at best complicit , and at worst the chief protagonist , in advocating offshore immigration detention policies that violate the united nations convention against torture , ' the letter reads .. the open letter , signed by the old boys and addressed to the old boys union , slammed the former immigration minister 's role in advocating australia 's detention centres. sydney boys high school : ` immediately rescind the invitation so as to spare the organisation , and the school itself , the embarrassment of being seen to celebrate the achievements of a man who has so flagrantly disregarded human rights , ' it read. it goes on to say that despite the signatories supporting ` free political discourse , dissent and contrasting opinions ' , this matter ` is not a question of restricting freedom of speech , but instead reflects the desire not to tacitly endorse the actions of a man who has demonstrated callous disregard for human rights .. ` it is cruel and insensitive for the union to laud this man 's connection to the school , its graduates , and their families .

ahead of super saturday , sportsmail 's sir clive woodward rates the three contenders for the 2015 rbs 6 nations title .... i 'm increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving .. despite missing chances against scotland , for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in .. george ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his bath team-mates starting alongside him .. but expect a much tougher defensive line against france .. most importantly , i believe england will win because they need to .. in stuart lancaster 's fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition .. a number of these players have been alongside lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win , most notably captain chris robshaw .. this is their best chance .. bath fly half george ford has brought confidence to the england backline this season. england and wasps flanker james haskell runs with the ball during training at pennyhill park on thursday. stuart lancaster has been in charge of england for four seasons but has yet to secure a six nations title. they have the points advantage , they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home .. everyone in twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere .. i expect england to play well .. i still rate the england pack very highly , though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker .. they have n't reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate graham rowntree .. it 's a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off .. geoff parling coming in is the right call , but i am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench .. if there 's an injury early on , can we expect nick easter to play most of the game there against france ?. england forwards coach graham rowntree oversees a ` live ' scrummaging session between his two packs. there have been many examples recently where england have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score .. lancaster 's side still lack the killer instinct against top sides .. also , france have been written off but that is completely wrong .. england will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter .. who would you pay to watch ?. he has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential .. i still believe that they need a better footballer at no 12 -- and not picking henry slade has been a missed opportunity -- but in joseph they have a player they can build a team around .. it is saying something that manu tuilagi 's absence has n't been felt too much .. i have also been hugely impressed with ford .. jonathan joseph has been electric in his year 's tournament and has the potential to become world class. video robshaw sets sights on france following scotland win. england operate more as a team of coaches , headed by lancaster -- compared with wales and ireland where warren gatland and joe schmidt are very much dominant figures .. i always put a great amount of stock in having everyone 's noses pointing in the same direction , but this becomes more difficult with more people involved .. there are few coaches around who have achieved this , as lancaster has with england .. despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing .. surrounding himself with rowntree , andy farrell and mike catt , he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere .. wingers anthony watson ( left ) and jack nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills. between jonny sexton , conor murray and paul o'connell they have the best game management side .. they also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well .. this goes for their kicking game as well , with rob kearney and tommy bowe 's consistency a real nuisance .. they are also playing scotland , even if the hosts do play better in edinburgh .. and if the game is dead for scotland with 20 minutes to go , will they mind hugely if it is the irish not the english who win the tournament ?. ireland fly half jonathan sexton ( centre ) gives instructions to his team-mates in cardiff last saturday. while i do n't think ireland will be concerned heading to murrayfield , they need to score at least three tries .. they should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points .. this would leave england having to win by 15 against france .. but can they cross the whitewash enough ?. who would you pay to watch ?. i worked with paul during the 2005 lions tour and although it was a losing tour , i am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him .. whatever position a youngster might play , they should look to how paul conducts himself on and off the field .. his work-rate , commitment and attitude is outstanding , but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is .. a real giant of the game .. paul o'connell rises high to claim a lineout against the welsh at the millenium stadium in round four. ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics .. they are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed .. in joe schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition .. schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent 's weak points and attacks them ruthlessly .. if that involves kicking every other play i have no problem with that .. they are hitting form at the right time and the way wales have bounced back from the defeat by england has been truly impressive .. i could see them running up a big score against italy .. they have the most to do in terms of points difference , but it would be fascinating if they could do what england did last year and put 50 points on italy .. wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going .. tighthead prop samson lee is a massive loss for warren gatland 's side ahead of their clash against italy. they need to keep italy to six points or less .. it is the scrum which can cause them problems , taking up territory and time .. losing prop samson lee is a massive blow .. who would you pay to watch ?. sam warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere .. his work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying .. take five minutes to watch warburton go about his work .. what i like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games .. he 's a real warrior any coach would want to work with .. sam warburton has led wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power. warren gatland 's c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him -- the welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop , especially when playing an inferior team .. beating ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch .. gatland brings the best out of shaun edwards , his defence coach , and the effort against ireland was world-class .. ireland will win by a few , wales will win by a lot and england will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points .. if i had a free bet , i 'd put it on ireland because if the scots implode they could rack up points .

'. suarez has become an important part of a three-pronged attack at barcelona since his arrival and has played some of the best form of his career .. however , the uruguayan striker remains self-critical and is only concentrating on being happy on the pitch and helping the squad .. suarez attempts to score past manchester city 's goalkeeper joe hart during a champions league clash. suarez said : ' i do n't know if this is my best moment of form .. i do know that i am happy , i feel like i am helping the team and that allows me to be relaxed .. ` it is n't difficult to have an understanding with players of barcelona 's quality .. ` but we have to continue in that vein , showing that we want to help the team and that nobody wants to steal the limelight , only to achieve big things . '. hart denies suarez as the former liverpool striker looks to score during the champions league clash

'. i thought to myself , i hope this old guy with a gun does n't do anything stupid . '. phillips said that ` the whole exchange took less than a minute ' outside the club and durst ` just stumbled a little as he walked down the block . ' '. i just thought he was an old man who was a little bit off .. i kept thinking this old guy is on too much prescription medication . '. durst , 71 , was arrested on the eve of sunday 's final episode of ` the jinx : the life and deaths of robert durst , ' and he agreed on monday to face trial for the murder of susan berman , who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished .. the final episode ended with the whispered words of durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom .. durst whispered before the sound of water running can be heard .. ` what the hell did i do ?. killed them all , of course . '. john phillips , 32 , a doorman at the mahogany jazz hall burlesque and absinthe house said durst revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon. the whispered words of durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom could come back to haunt him - or help him - as he faces a murder charge. now those words could come back to haunt him -- or help him -- as he faces his murder charge .. a possible move by prosecutors to introduce the incriminating material from a six-part documentary on his strange life and connection to three killings could backfire as interview footage did in the michael jackson molestation trial and the robert blake murder case .. in both cases , the defense was allowed under the ` doctrine of completeness ' to provide segments of interviews that presented their clients favorably without subjecting them to tough cross-examination . '. i submit that blake did n't have to testify and michael jackson did n't have to testify because the prosecution foolishly wanted to introduce portions of their interviews , ' said attorney thomas mesereau jr. , who represented both men .. ` they just got greedy .. they were mesmerized by portions they thought could help them .

'. i would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials , ' said george fisher , a former prosecutor and professor at stanford law school .. ` the flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face . '. in the case of blake , prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with barbara walters because it contradicted other evidence .. the defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview .. ` it did a great deal both to humanize him and so he was n't just seen as a celebrity , ' said m. gerald schwartzbach , who won blake 's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife .. ` there was an image projected that a lot of people had about robert as a difficult person .. in this video , he came across as a very sympathetic person .

'. peter box , transport spokesman at the local government association , said : ` councils fixed more potholes than ever before last year - one every 15 seconds - despite spiralling multi-million pound compensation costs and funding cuts .. the estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years , a new report claims. ` it is hugely frustrating yet unsurprising that , despite our best efforts , we have not been able to make a dent in the # 12 billion roads repair backlog .. patching up our crumbling road network is simply not the answer to tackle the roads crisis we face as a country .. ` councils need billions , not millions , to bring our roads up to scratch .. every mile of motorways and trunk roads will receive # 1.4 million funding over the next six years compared with # 31,000 per mile for local roads .. this makes little sense given the government 's own traffic projections predict an increase in local traffic of more than 40 % by 2040 . '. professor stephen glaister , director of the rac foundation , said : ` back in 2010 the top transport priority amongst voters was filling in the potholes .. five years later and an rac foundation poll shows fixing our roads and pavements remains the public 's number one concern .. ` the extra chunks of cash spent on road maintenance over the last parliament have been welcome but with a record number of cars on the road , rising traffic volume and routine resurfacing work taking place only half as frequently as in the 1980s , this issue is unlikely to slip far down the list of things people want ministers to tackle .

paul murray has lambasted the ibrox regimes of recent years and insisted they should be ` ashamed ' of the damage inflicted on the club .. the interim chairman spoke out as rangers announced they had accepted a # 1.5 million loan from the three bears consortium -- cutting off any prospect of drawing down a second # 5m advance from mike ashley 's sports direct firm .. douglas park , george letham and george taylor are lending the money without any security , interest or fees .. paul murray is angry at decisions made by previous board at rangers. the new ibrox board say they will use the cash to keep the club functioning while they finalise a ` medium to long-term ' funding package for their rebuilding plans .. dave king is expected to play a significant financial role at that point , having temporarily stepped back as he seeks to prove to the sfa that he should be deemed ` fit and proper ' to become chairman .. murray is filling the role for now and -- in conjunction with fellow directors park , john gilligan and john bennett -- has been analysing the various contracts inherited after taking control on march 6 .. he has now castigated decisions taken by the former board -- which comprised david somers , derek llambias , barry leach and james easdale -- and those who preceded them in the wake of craig whyte 's ruinous reign .. ` many of the people who have occupied the ibrox boardroom during that period should be ashamed of themselves for the parts they played in dragging this great institution towards near financial ruin , ' said murray .. dave king ( right ) is expected to play a significant financial role at rangers. ` it is actually difficult to look closely at the club 's finances and understand the rationale behind some of the decisions taken .. ` let me give just two examples of the recklessness displayed by those who were removed from office just more than two weeks ago .. ` one is the amount -- in the region of # 300,000 -- spent on a needless general meeting and the other is the signing of five newcastle loan players without medicals .. this is simply appalling .

'. the previous board agreed a two-stage # 10m loan from sports direct , which gained 75 per cent of the club 's retail operation and various securities in return .. ` we have already made it clear we are happy to engage with sports direct but the board has decided against drawing down the second # 5m tranche of sports direct 's # 10m loan , ' said murray .. ` we are still in the process of reviewing all of the contractual relationships that sports direct has with the club .

one of the british twin sisters who have travelled to syria to become jihadi brides was caught looking at an extremist-linked image on her school computer six months before she fled the country , it has emerged .. salma halane , 17 , downloaded a photograph of isis fighters in december 2013 , using a computer at connell sixth form college in manchester .. when teachers found out , she told them she was trying to find her brother who had gone to syria .. terror : salma halane , left , looked up an image of isis fighters online six months before she travelled to syria with her twin sister zahra , right. six months later , salma and her twin sister zahra fled to the war-torn country , where they are believed to have married jihadist fighters from the bloodthirsty terror group .. the isis-related photograph which salma viewed online was spotted by teachers when they were reviewing pupils ' internet usage .. the school says that she was twice spoken to by staff about the picture , and advised to talk to her family about her worries over her brother , while teachers subsequently discussed the issue with her parents .. however , staff did not tell the police of any concerns about the girl .. after the twins disappeared in june last year , the school handed all their internet browsing records over to anti-terrorism investigators to help them track salma and zahra down .. school : connell sixth form college discovered the image on one of its own computers. jihad : this picture of female isis fighters was shared by salma on her twitter feed after she went to syria. a spokesman for bright futures educational trust , which runs the college , said there was no reason not to believe salma 's explanation for why she was viewing the image .. she added : ` as part of the college 's daily routine we review all internet browsing records .. we promptly challenge students on anything that stands out during that review .. ` in december 2013 we discovered that salma halane had viewed an image on a mainstream news website in the hope of spotting her missing brother .. our priority was her emotional wellbeing , and we recommended she speak to her mother about her concern for her brother and the college followed this up .. ` once it became clear that the girls had travelled to syria , we handed over all computer records to the counter terrorism unit ( ctu ) .. these were reviewed and nothing was discovered that caused them concern . '. training : another image sent out by salma appears to show women in burqas being taught how to shoot. an education source told the manchester evening news that the school should have done more to intervene after they saw that salma had been looking at terror-related content online . '. i have no doubt whatsoever that if someone at the college had followed this up with salma , she would still be in this country , ' the source said . '. i think there should have been a real concern that she was becoming radicalised . '. salma and zahra were among the first pupils at connell sixth form college , which opened as a state-funded free school in september 2013 .. the twin girls , from the manchester suburb of chorlton , had 28 gcses between them and were hoping to become doctors before they ran away to join isis .. their parents tried to travel to syria to bring the girls back home , but were unable to persuade them to leave the war zone .. a number of british schoolgirls are believed to have left the country to become jihadi brides - last month , three teenagers from east london abandoned their families and travelled to syria .
the worry for england is that things could get worse before they get better .. the cricket itself is bad enough .. but we 're thinking of events off the field : if they were handed the keys to ecb headquarters , the borgias and the chuckle brothers would probably bicker less and command more gravitas than the current lot .. one of the side-effects of england 's horrible performance at the world cup was to bring forward the moment when our game would have to confront itself .. while they were still in the tournament , there was always the promise of a horizon to cross , an itch to scratch , a wrong to right .. the most alarming development of another improbable week was alastair cook 's outburst in abu dhabi .. it was no coincidence that the most heartfelt press conference of his career took place beyond the grasp of the ecb ( perhaps beginning the county season in the middle east does have something to recommend it after all ) .. england vice captain jos buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field after their world cup exit. england 's exit at the world cup was humiliating as they went out in adelaide , australia. england coach peter moores ( left ) at the end of the world cup match between england and bangladesh. more to the point , he has n't got his head round his sacking as one-day captain .. neither fact reflects well on the english game .. his cri de coeur came not long after coach peter moores had assured us that cook had dealt with the disappointment of being axed only weeks before the world cup .. thoughts returned to the days before that axing , when moores stressed his support for cook 's leadership ; once the leadership was over , moores said it was ` the right thing to do ' .. something is clearly being lost in translation .. and it had better be reinterpreted fast : england are about to embark on 17 tests in 10 months .. it is a period that will define both captain and coach , assuming they emerge unscathed .. yet cook also needs to be frank with himself .. the reason he should n't have been sacked so soon before a world cup was that he should have been sacked well in advance , and allowed to focus on what -- until two years ago -- he was good at : churning out test runs .. instead , he has now been critical not just of the decision to sack him , but also -- by implication -- of eoin morgan 's leadership .. alastair cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in abu dhabi. alastair cook trudges off the field in abu dhabi after falling for five following just three in the first innings. for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on twitter : @the_topspin. team insiders believe his words came out the wrong way .. but had they been uttered by kevin pietersen , they would have brought howls of ` insubordination ' .. and pietersen , lapping up the limelight once more , has loved every minute .. ever since colin graves appeared to suggest there was a way back , he has taken every opportunity to stay in the headlines .. this is his prerogative , and it has at least served to expose the ecb 's continued mismanagement of the saga .. to hear the national selector james whitaker dead-bat questions from the bbc last week was to wonder at the task awaiting the ecb 's new head of communications , chris haynes .. meanwhile , confusion continues over what exactly graves said to pietersen .. reports vary : he 's offered an olive branch , no he has n't ; he 's assured cook that pietersen wo n't play for england again , no he has n't ; he 's told pietersen there are no guarantees , no he ... you get the picture .. and all this , remember , before graves has even replaced giles clarke as chairman .. in some ways , graves deserves our sympathy : he has inherited a mess which he presumably did n't envisage while he was operating under the radar as clarke 's deputy .. and his statement on pietersen -- play county cricket or there really is no hope -- had the virtue of treating him like a member of civilised society .. kevin pietersen will have nine county championship matches at the most to impress england 's selectors. he 's secured a released from sunrisers hyderabad to stake his claim for an england return in the ashes. but the latest bout of confused messages , simmering feuds and egotistical grandstanding are a reminder that english cricket should be careful when it next mocks , say , the pakistanis or the west indians for presiding over complete chaos .. it 's over a year now since pietersen was told to pack up his troubles in his old kit bag .. yet , in the eyes of the public , the ecb are no closer to moving on .. on the contrary : the crowd watching the sideshow is threatening to outnumber those who can still be bothered with the cricket .. pietersen has played the media game with his customary flair , befriending those he once disdained .. but it 's up to the ecb to take charge .. if they imagine they can win his silence while planning not to pick him -- and that , by the way , is their plan -- then cook 's meltdown may not be the last .. there 's nothing like the pricking of officialdom 's bubble to soothe the soul .. when the icc posted what they thought was a congratulatory tweet to the ireland team on a ` memorable and inspiring ' world cup , they enthused : ` see what captain @purdy34 had to say here ... '. ` captain @purdy34 ' , aka will porterfield , saved twitter users the bother of clicking on the icc 's link by responding directly with a tweet of his own : ' @icc so memorable and inspiring that you have decided to cut the next wc to 10 teams .. what is your vision for the game of cricket ? '. funnily enough , the many replies did not include one from the icc .. william porterfield saved twitter users the bother of clicking on the icc 's link by responding directly. it 's hardly unprecedented for politicians to thump a few tubs in an attempt to rally their constituents .. so , as bangladesh fumed over the no-ball that was n't during their quarter-final defeat by india -- fondly imagining that a semi-final place had been wrenched from their grasp -- their head cricket honcho mustafa kamal cheerfully fumed : ` it seems the icc has become the indian cricket council . '. the joke was lost on the icc , which was hardly surprising : kamal is their president .. worse , he reportedly threatened to resign if the icc -- his icc -- did n't investigate the umpiring .. in the circumstances , icc chief executive david richardson might have been lost for words .. instead he managed a faintly splenetic : ` as an icc president , he should have been more considerate in his criticism of icc match officials , whose integrity can not be questioned . '. needless to say , kamal later dismissed reports of his threat to quit as ` rumours ' .. bangladesh cricket board ( bcb ) president mustafa kamal ( right ) pictured during a press conference. it 's not the icc 's fault that the world cup quarter-finals were mainly one-sided , memorable only for individual feats -- rohit sharma , wahab riaz , martin guptill .. but , as i wrote in the 2012 wisden , the tournament would benefit from losing the quarter-finals altogether .. the quarters are a nice conceit : they ensure seven knockout matches rather than three , and create the illusion that there are eight teams who can actually lift the trophy .. but their presence continues to make a turkey of the group stage , which stretches over a month and is grateful for whatever storylines are tossed its way .. so here 's the plan : allow 12 teams to take part in 2019 ( not 10 , as per the icc 's plan ) , stage two groups of six ( all play all ) , and scrap the quarter-finals altogether .. with only two teams progressing from each group , all the early matches would be meaningful , which would more than compensate for the loss of the quarters .. and the associates would get their chance without being accused of contributing to a meaningless first phase .. only 33 matches , compared with the 49 we have now .. tv would n't like it , even if many fans would accept the shortfall in return for the prolonged tension .. and even one game a day would still allow the tournament to last a month .. icc , over to you .
washington ( cnn ) in a strongly worded letter , the white house saturday told senate foreign relations chairman bob corker ( r-tn ) a bill he is drafting would likely have a " profoundly negative impact " on the ongoing negotiations between the u.s. and iran over tehran 's nuclear program .. corker is working on legislation that would force the obama administration to submit any deal reached with iran for a vote by congress .. the white house earlier threatened to veto such a measure .. white house chief of staff denis mcdonough , in the three page letter released publicly saturday evening , told corker his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with iran by " emboldening iranian hard-liners , inviting a counter-productive response from the iranian majiles ( majles , the parliament ) ; differentiating the u.s. position from our allies in the negotiations ; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal . ". as the u.s. and iran prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week , there has been a growing debate between republicans on capitol hill and the obama administration about how much authority congress has regarding the fate of the agreement .. " the legislation you have introduced in the senate goes well beyond ensuring that congress has a role to play in any deal with iran .. instead , the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that congress must vote to ` approve ' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the president , " mcdonough wrote .. the chief of staff said that only congress can terminate the existing iran sanctions that are included in laws , but the president can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally .. one of the major issues between the u.s. and iran is the timetable for lifting of the sanctions .. " if congressional action is perceived as preventing us from reaching a deal , it will create divisions within the international community , putting at risk the very international cooperation that has been essential to our ability to pressure iran .. put simply , it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions , while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions " now in place , mcdonough said in his letter .. for his part , corker on sunday released a statement : " on this issue where congress has played such a vital role , i believe it is very important that congress appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented . ". corker also urged the president not to go to the united nations for a vote regarding lifting of the sanctions on iran , as reuters reported was being considered .. " enabling the united nations to consider an agreement or portions of it , while simultaneously threatening to veto legislation that would enable congress to do the same , is a direct affront to the american people and seeks to undermine congress ' appropriate role , " he wrote .. the chief of staff told corker , " the administration 's request to the congress is simple : let us complete the negotiations before the congress acts on legislation " and added " we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the united states . ". mcdonough also mentioned a separate letter sent to iran 's leadership and signed by 47 republican senators .. corker did not sign it .. the letter maintained that a future president could reverse some of what is agreed to in these ongoing negotiations and said any agreement reached would need congressional approval .. it has generated much controversy .. it also drew rebuttal from iran 's foreign minister , who called it a propaganda ploy .. on sunday , iran 's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said the letter signed by the senators tarnished washington 's reputation internationally , according to state-run tasnim news agency .. he said it showed that the united states is untrustworthy , and he advised current negotiators to be wary .. mcdonough also said the letter 's premise was incorrect .. " non-binding agreements -- like the deal we are negotiating with iran ... are an essential element of international diplomacy and do not require congressional approval , " mcdonough said .. secretary of state john kerry , who heads back to switzerland on sunday for more talks with iranian representatives , again blasted that letter from the 47 republicans ..

a powdered alcohol intended to be mixed up into drinks has gained approval from a federal regulator .. the product , called palcohol , had received the greenlight from the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error .. on wednesday , bureau spokesman tom hogue told the associated press the issues were resolved and that four varieties of palcohol were approved .. but hogue noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders .. dry booze : a brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau .. the maker of palcohol hopes to start selling the product by summer .. a few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above. the approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy .. several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol , including lawmakers in colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale .. that bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval .. concerns have included abuse by minors , the potential to snort the powder and whether palcohol 's light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks .. palcohol would come in a pouch , with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink .. a statement on palcohol 's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer .. palcohol founder mark phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early wednesday morning , and said in a subsequent email that pricing has n't yet been determined .. ` we are n't commenting on production or distribution at this time , ' he wrote .. the four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan , a margarita , vodka and rum .. phillips added that he expects another palcohol product -- lemon drop -- should also be ` approved shortly . '. previously , phillips had said he came up with the idea for palcohol because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles .. hogue said the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau regularly reaches out to the food and drug administration to get determinations on whether a product might be considered ` adulterated . '. if the fda says the product is n't adulterated , he said the bureau 's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what 's in the product .. ` potential for abuse is n't grounds for us to deny a label , ' hogue said .
families will enjoy the biggest boost to their finances for more than a decade as inflation is set to tumble to zero while wages rise .. inflation has already plunged to 0.3 per cent -- its lowest level since 1960 -- after a big fall in the cost of essentials such as food and fuel .. and bank of england governor mark carney told parliament yesterday that it would ` likely fall further to around zero in the coming months , and remain near there for much of the year ' .. mark carney said prices were likely to remain flat for the rest of the year because of falling prices of oil and food. the bank also forecasts that real post-tax income is expected to rise by 3.5 per cent this year as the long squeeze on living standards comes to an end .. that means british households can expect their biggest boost in spending power since 2001 , experts say .. chancellor george osborne hopes that the easing pressure on family finances and the continuing economic recovery will help the conservatives at may 's general election .. tory strategists believe the party 's move ahead of labour in recent opinion polls shows more voters are starting to feel the benefits of the economic turnaround .. labour planned to make a ` cost of living crisis ' a major election issue , but the news seems to support conservative claims that their economic plan is working .. last night the treasury hailed mr carney 's inflation forecast as ` good news ' for households .. mr carney , giving evidence to the house of lords economic affairs committee , said : ` the combination of rising wages and weak headline inflation will strengthen household finances and boost real take-home pay growth this year to the fastest rate in a decade .. in turn , this will support continued solid growth in consumer spending . '. inflation has already hit the lowest level on record - hitting just 0.3 per cent in january - but mr carney said it would be ` extremely foolish ' to slash interest rates to try to get inflation back to its target rate of 2 per cent. mr carney warned that interest rates are likely to rise at some point -- but said that when that happens the increases will be ` gradual ' and ` limited ' .. rates have been frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent for more than six years .. there has been speculation that the bank could cut rates even further -- towards zero -- if inflation threatened to fall too far and turn into a dangerous bout of deflation .. such a move would spell misery for savers -- who have already missed out on around # 130billion in interest payments because of ultra-low rates -- but would be welcomed by borrowers .. but mr carney yesterday insisted that it would be ` extremely foolish ' to cut rates to counter the uncontrollable fall in global oil prices .. he said it would risk adding ` unnecessary volatility in inflation ' and that he expects inflation to return to its 2 per cent target ` within two years ' .. a report by the british chambers of commerce , published today , predicts interest rates will rise to 0.75 per cent ` no earlier ' than the first three months of next year .. the bcc is also raising its uk growth forecasts from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent for this year and from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent in 2016 .. that follows expansion of 2.6 per cent last year -- when the uk was the fastest growing economy in the g7 group of leading nations .. growth is expected to pick up to 0.7 per cent in the first three months of this year following a 0.5 per cent rise in output in the final quarter of last year .. john longworth , director general of the bcc , said : ` businesses up and down the country are doing well despite international and domestic uncertainty .. ` while 2015 has got off to a good start , there is no room for complacency .. the uk is still a long way from achieving the great , sustainable , long-term growth we want to see . '. a treasury spokesman said : ` the latest economic forecasts from the bcc are yet further proof that our long-term economic plan is working , with the strongest growth of any major advanced economy last year and showing upgrades to uk growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016 .. but the bcc are right to say the job is not yet done so we must keep working through the plan that is delivering economic security in an uncertain world economy . '. inflation as measured by the consumer prices index was last at zero or below between december 1959 and march 1960 , according to the office for national statistics .

sir jeremy heywood , nicknamed ` sir cover-up ' has overseen a move that will ban civil servants from speaking to journalists without prior approval. a ban on civil servants talking to journalists without prior ministerial approval will ` intimidate ' them into silence , critics said last night .. the civil service code has been revised , with the threat that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister .. a line has been added to the code , saying : ` ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media . '. as well as raising concerns about the transparency of government , there are fears the revision could dissuade whistleblowers from coming forward -- meaning scandals could go undetected .. the move , which follows a similar clampdown on members of the armed forces talking to the media , has been overseen by cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood , the head of the home civil service .. he has been nicknamed ` sir cover-up ' for preventing the chilcot inquiry into the iraq war from seeing letters and records of phone calls between tony blair and george bush .. his influence is such that david cameron is said to have once joked : ` remind me , jeremy , do you work for me or do i work for you ? '. a source at the cabinet office -- which is in charge of the civil service -- insisted the move was an attempt to increase ministers ' accountability of civil servants in their department .. francis maude , cabinet office minister , promised to ensure that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained .. but dave penman of the fda union , which represents whitehall officials , said the move was an ` unnecessary , unworkable and unjustified restriction ' .. ` the public has a right to open and transparent public services , yet this change now requires ministerial authorisation before a civil servant can respond or make any contact with the media -- from a prosecutor being asked for comment outside of court , to a job centre manager dealing with a local news story , ' he added .. ` guidance to regulate contact between civil servants and the media is already in place and we can see no justification for this sudden , drastic change , other than intimidating civil servants into silence ... this knee-jerk decision seems to have only been made to sate unfounded and misguided ministerial mistrust . '. mark serwotka , of the public and commercial services union , said the ban was an attempt to ` prevent public servants from telling the truth about government policy , by a minister who has already admitted he wants to do as much damage as possible before he steps down by making his reforms " irreversible "' .. francis maude , cabinet office minister , promised that the right of whistleblowers would be maintained. the extension to the civil service code means the government has effectively ordered more than 400,000 people not to talk to reporters without its approval .. a spokesman for the cabinet office said the rule ` clarifies ' an existing requirement that civil servants must ` clear material for publication in advance ' .. he added : ` there is no change to the important rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation which is protected by statute . '. in a letter to the fda union , mr maude said he proposes to include ` a footnote referencing the whistleblowing legislation within the revised code ' .

u.s. narcotics agents with top secret clearances had wild ` sex parties ' with prostitutes hired by colombian drug cartel members , according to a blockbuster report from the justice department 's internal investigations arm .. the drug enforcement agency has yet to comment on the findings in the exposé from the doj 's office of inspector general .. at least seven dea agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments .. but instead of firing or prosecuting them , the agency treated their cases as a ` local management issue ' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days .. the ig cautioned in the report , released thursday morning , that u.s. law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex -- even in places where it 's legal or unofficially tolerated -- can be vulnerable to ` coercion , extortion , and blackmail . '. the republican chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the justice department after the report surfaced online , calling its allegations ` truly stunning . '. ` let there be no mistake , this is a national security threat , ' said utah rep. jason chaffetz .. scroll down to read the report. trouble in colombia : drug enforcement agency officers had hooker parties allegedly paid for with drug cartel money. narco-pervs : dea agents had top secret clearances when they went on sex romps with hookers. ` we need to hold them accountable and , given the clear evidence in the oig report , they should be fired immediately , ' he said of the offending agents .. ` we need to weed out those who risk our national security , embarrass the county , and skirt the law . '. chaffetz promised that his panel , the house oversight and government reform committee , ` will pursue this vigorously ' after next week 's congressional recess .. in all , the ig report flagged 621 cases where agents in the fbi , dea , atf and u.s marchalls service were accused of a wide variety of sex-related offenses .. they ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates .. in the prostitudion cases , the ig wrote , ` dea supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue ' even though the ` these special agents held top secret clearances . '. one case involved agents ` patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting .. ... it was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors ' group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute . '. ` the acting assistant regional director who supervised the two special agents in this case , ' investigators wrote , ` was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... in that case , the aard allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the aard 's honor . '. ` there were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated . '. in all , six hookers attended that soiree .. supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the doj for disciplinary action .. a tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents , claiming in an anonymous letter to dea higher-ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour-of-duty assignments .. in a separate case , the inspector general describes dea agents who attended prostitute ` sex parties arranged by a colombian law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves .. the parties , the ig said , happened in the agents ' government-leased apartments over a period of several years .. agents ' laptops , blackberry devices , and other government-issued equipment were typically lying around , creating ` potential security risks ' and potentially making agents vulnerable to ` extortion , blackmail , or coercion . '. foreign officers later claimed they held on to the american agents ' guns while they were indulging in the hooker-fests .. they also claimed they gave three dea supervisory agents ` money , expensive gifts , and weapons from drug cartel members . '. ultimately , 7 of the 10 agents the ig interviewed admitted taking part in the ` sex parties . '. they were suspended for between 2 and 10 days , but never prosecuted criminally .. overall , the dea limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days , in part because colombian authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade .. ` the dea inspector told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called " tolerance zones " , ' the gi wrote .. ` according to the inspector , it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers . '. angry : ` let there be no mistake , this is a national security threat , ' said utah rep. jason chaffetz. the doj 's inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the fbi , dea , atf and us marshals service , including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors. the u.s. marshalls service also got a black eye in the inspector general report .. in one 2010 case described in detail , two deputy marshalls traevled to thailand to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the united states .. every time the state department tried to contact one of the men , one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he could n't be disturbed .

'. management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system ; he insisted he had done it before with no problem .. separately , an fbi assistant section chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues ` engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7-year period , ' according to the report .. his partners included ` foreign nationals , including prostitutes , strippers , students in his classes , and members of foreign law enforcement .

labour has been accused of suppressing a major report because it did not support its claim that the nhs is under threat from privatisation .. the health select committee was due to publish its study of nhs funding before the election .. but , according to conservative mps on the all-party committee , it had heard little evidence of fundamental changes to the health service as a result of coalition reforms .. the mps were told that , on the contrary , the pace of privatisation had actually slowed since the election , and that there had been no extension of charges and top-ups -- meaning that there was no reason to think the nhs would not remain free at the point of use .. healthcare row : tory mps on the health select committee have accused four labour counterparts of blocking a report that suggested the ` pace of privatisation ' in the nhs has in fact slowed since the last election. this dealt a blow to labour 's argument that david cameron can not be trusted with the nhs .. rather than publish the report weeks before the election , the four labour committee members blocked it after reading a draft , claimed their tory counterparts charlotte leslie , robert jenrick and andrew percy .. mr percy , the mp for brigg and goole , said : ` this is despicable .. we heard hours and hours of evidence , but because it does not support the national party line about the nhs being under threat , they block it .. ` labour were only interested if they could use it to weaponise the nhs . '. last night , the angry tory mps released a dossier of some of the report 's findings .. it said : ` the weight of evidence ... showed there had not been an extension of charges , of top-ups during the current parliament , and that these are not planned .. ` it showed very little increase in private-sector providers since 2010 [ and ] a general trend of declining administration costs in the nhs . '. it added that independent provider admissions had increased by just 0.6 per cent under the coalition 's health and social care act , while foundation trusts now receive a lower proportion of their income from private patients than during labour 's time in power .. conflict : tory mps charlotte leslie ( left ) , robert jenrick and andrew percy claim their rivals blocked the report because it made the conservatives look good , but labour mp valerie vaz says the report they released themselves ` did not make full use of the evidence '. the dossier also said expenditure on nhs administration had fallen from 5.1 per cent in 2009/10 to a planned 2.7 per cent in 2015/16 .. and it found that nothing ` suggests that continuing with a comprehensive tax-funded nhs is intrinsically undoable ' .. mr percy said : ` they said the report was too pro-government .. but that 's ridiculous , because many of our reports have been very critical of the government .. ` on this occasion , the evidence simply did n't support what labour wanted to hear . '. valerie vaz , a labour mp on the committee , told the spectator : ` this was a private meeting and i am disappointed a colleague has publicised their version of what was said .. ` the report ... did not make full use of the evidence .. at a different point in the parliamentary cycle ... there would have been time to redraft the report as we have done previously .

a freshman senator who spearheaded a letter to iranian leaders , cautioning them that any deal negotiated by the obama administration would not outlast the current president , defended his actions on tuesday as necessary to prevent the middle eastern country from becoming nuclear capable .. ` they 've been killing americans for 35 years , they 've killed hundreds of troops in iraq , now they control five capitols in the middle east , ` arkansas sen. tom cotton said tuesday on msnbc .. ` they are nothing but hardliners in iran and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon , imagine what they would do with one . '. cotton 's remarks came after vice president joe biden , the official president of the senate and a former representative for delaware to the upper chamber , sent out a biting statement monday evening accusing letter signers of acting ` beneath the dignity ' of their office .. ` they 've been killing americans for 35 years , they 've killed hundreds of troops in iraq , now they control five capitols in the middle east , ' arkansas sen. tom cotton said tuesday on msnbc program morning joe while defending his controversial letter to iranian leaders. the letter , signed by 47 republican senators , told iranians the senate will ` consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between president obama and ayatollah khamenei . '. reminding the foreign government that u.s. president barack obama is ineligible for a third term and will leave office in january 2017 , ' the gop lawmakers said ` most of us will remain in office well beyond then -- perhaps decades . '. in previewing the letter to bloomberg , cotton said monday ` iran 's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that ... any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril . '. the white house , state department and democratic leaders denounced the audacious move and warned that it could have the intended effect - the dismantlement of the obama and other world leaders ' blossoming agreement with tehran .. state department spokeswoman jen psaki said it ` undermines ' negotiations .. white house press secretary josh earnest said it ` certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks .. republicans ' effort to ` essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful , ' earnest told reporters during his daily briefing on monday .. vice president joe biden lashed out at republicans on monday night in a statement distributed to reporters through the white house 's massive press list .. the message , ` expressly designed to undercut a sitting president in the midst of sensitive international negotiations , is beneath the dignity of an institution i revere , ' biden said , arguing that he had never seen anything like it during his thirty-six years in the senate . '. i can not recall another instance in which senators wrote directly to advise another country -- much less a longtime foreign adversary -- that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them , ' he said .. ` this letter sends a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our commander-in-chief can not deliver on america 's commitments -- a message that is as false as it is dangerous . '. firing back at the vp on tuesday morning during an appearance on morning joe , cotton said if biden ` respects the dignity of the institution of the senate he should be insisting that the president submit any deal to approval of the senate , which is exactly what he did on numerous deals during his time in senate . '. he also attacked biden 's foreign policy credentials .. ` joe biden , as barack obama 's own secretary of defense has said , has been wrong about nearly every foreign policy and national security decision in the last 40 years , ' cotton said in remarks captured by politico .. the arkansas lawmaker was referring to former dod head robert gates , who deprecated biden in a memoir released after he exited obama 's cabinet .. biden , another likely candidate for president in 2016 , is a former chairman of the senate 's foreign relation 's committee .. he was initially added to obama 's ticket in 2008 to counter the freshman senator 's relative lack of experience with world affairs .. he was not alone in his condemnation of his former colleagues ' actions .. connecticut sen. richard blumenthal said republicans ' ` very blatant effort to undermine the legitimacy ' of the president and ` disrespect ' his as a negotiator is ` unconscionable . '. they essentially said the president ` does n't speak for the constitution , ' he told cnn tuesday morning .. virginia democratic sen. tim kaine lambasted cotton and his co-signers tuesday on the senate floor , even while conceding that he partially agrees with their position . '. i share many of the concerns of my colleagues , the 47 who wrote the letter , ' kaine said .. ` but i deeply believe , ' he added , ` we should not try to tank a deal , critique a deal , undercut a deal , before there is a deal . '. he criticized cotton without naming him , for writing ` to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state . '. ` the message that is communicated to the american public and to the world is , we will never accept any deal , ' he said of the letter .. ` we are not interested in diplomacy .. we are not interested in negotiation . '. ` and that attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of iran , which is currently engaging in terrorist activity .. thy would want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent the united states that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith . '. iran 's foreign minister mohammed javad zarif said tuesday , ` this kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic . '. ` in fact it implies that the united states is not trustworthy , ' he said according to iran 's state-run news site .. the letter , signed by 47 republican senators , told iranians the senate will ` consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between president obama and ayatollah khamenei '. the white house on monday reproached senators for acting outside ` the role our founding fathers envisioned congress for to play when it comes to foreign affairs ' and questioned the ` wisdom of their strategy . '. ` the rush to war , or at least the to the military option that many republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the united states , ' earnest said .. republicans have not specifically lobbied for military engagement with iran , but its the white house 's view that war could come about if world leaders do not at least attempt to negotiate a deal with iran in good faith .. psaki contended monday that senators wrongly implied that they have any say over a possible agreement .. ` congress does n't have the power to alter the conditions of international arrangements negotiated by the executive , ' she said .. additionally , the state department is of the opinion ` that this letter , designed to score political points , ignores the fact that executive agreements between countries provide things like protections for troops , that we rely on every day , allows for the basing of american service members overseas , allows for us to obstruct the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the high seas , ' she said .. while it is true that congress does not currently have the authority to authorize the pact as it 's not technically a treaty , the senate will soon vote on a bipartisan measure that would give the legislative body the power of review over any package the administration offers iran .. and , as cotton noted tuesday morning on cnn 's new day , several of the republican senators who lent their name to the letter are considering presidential bids and could , in two years , potentially be calling the shots in the oval office . '. i welcome even hillary clinton to join us because i suspect she might have reservations about this ill-fated nuclear deal as well , ' he said , name-checking the democratic front-runner for president .. vice president joe biden , pictured here at the international association of firefighters legislative conference and presidential forum on monday , sent out a biting statement that evening accusing letter signers of acting ` beneath the dignity ' of their office. from left , secretary of state john kerry , biden and national security adviser susan rice listen as president barack obama meets with european council president donald tusk in the oval office on monday .. the state department said the gop 's letter to iran ` undermines ' nuclear negotiations .. the white house said it ` certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks. asked about the gop senators ' attempt to undercut his foreign policy strategy on monday , obama said he thought it was ` ironic ' that they were aligning themselves with iran 's hardliners , who also do n't want a deal to go through .. in his unusually long statement , biden said the senators ' letter , sent ` in the guise of a constitutional lesson , ignores two centuries of precedent and threatens to undermine the ability of any future american president , whether democrat or republican , to negotiate with other nations on behalf of the united states . '. ` around the world , america 's influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments . '. the united states must ` maintain our credibility and global leadership even as presidents and congresses come and go , ' he wrote .. ` the decision to undercut our president and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle , ' he continued .. ` as a matter of policy , the letter and its authors have also offered no viable alternative to the diplomatic resolution with iran that their letter seeks to undermine . '. republicans have said that instead of diplomatic negotiations and a deal that would allow iran to continue working toward a peaceful nuclear program , they would like to bury the country with sanctions until it completely abandons its uranium enrichment program .. blumenthal said tuesday that cotton and other legislators had polarized and undermined a bipartisan coalition of senators ` which is now in tatters ' that were demanding the white house allow the senate to have the final say over any deal it negotiated with tehran .. the democratic senator said he was determined to ` stitch it back together , ' however .. sen. angus king , an independent who caucuses with the democrats , said the irony of the situation was that the senate 's bill , sponsored by foreign relations chairman bob corker , requiring congressional oversight was headed toward a veto-proof majority before this .. now , republican have ` blown that , ' he said on cnn , and ` literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . '. the white house said it ` certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks

( cnn ) are the upcoming elections in israel crucial ?. will the results -- a fourth term for prime minister benjamin netanyahu or a first for opposition leader isaac herzog -- change israel 's policy in a significant way ?. as israelis prepare to go to the polls , the answer seems to be negative .. many observers in europe and the united states seem to be under the impression that during netanyahu 's time in power , israel was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that herzog , leader of the zionist union opposition party , is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity .. but the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of israel and the middle east -- what to do about the palestinians -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible , a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric .. while netanyahu 's insistence on israel 's continued ruling over millions of palestinians is expressed in aggressive , often religious and nationalistic language , herzog 's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the western world .. but at the end of the day , neither netanyahu nor herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the palestinian territories .. netanyahu says it clearly and openly ; herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it .. read more : 5 key issues for next israeli leader. this whitewash has been so evident throughout the entire election campaign that a foreigner arriving in israel would have had a hard time understanding anything about what is really going on here .. the main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living , housing prices , government oversight -- but even then , slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in-depth debates we should be having .. but the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals , some of them concerning the behavior of netanyahu and his wife sara .. there was the " bottlegate " affair -- claims that the wife of the prime minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence .. the netanyahus say they reimbursed the government .. israel is a country that is still looking for its way forward ; one that lacks internationally recognized borders ; one that has not yet decided whether it is a western society or a middle eastern one ; one that can not decide whether it wants to be religious or secular , jewish or bi-national .. all of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside , ignored , covered up or denied by a country that has busied itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister 's residence .. there is a big elephant in the room , but israel is turning its back to it .. there is a big elephant in the room , but israel believes that if nobody talks about it , the elephant does not exist .. this elephant is absent from the israeli discourse on a day-to-day basis , and it is absent during elections -- a time when public discourse should be only be focused on what really matters .. the elephant in the israeli room is the unending occupation of palestinian territories , and nobody is talking about it .. most of the parties running in the elections have not even bothered to try to answer questions about what their plans are for the palestinians .. but the occupation also continues to be a non-issue for too many ordinary israelis , who know very little -- and care even less -- about the cruel reality for the millions of palestinians who live without civil rights in the west bank and who are kept under siege in gaza .. for those who regard herzog and the center-left as the great hope of this campaign , it is important to remember that it was the israeli labor party who established the occupation and settlement projects in palestinian territory .. golda meir , moshe dayan , shimon peres , yitzhak rabin : those labor leaders , so beloved by the west , are the founding fathers of the most significant venture of modern israel -- the illegal transfer of a jewish population to stolen land .. it was a project whose purpose was to prevent any kind of equal division of the land , or a settlement with the palestinians -- and as such it has been a great success story .. labor never had a real plan for the palestinians , except to time and again renew the endless peace process , which may be the longest in history .. this is still true now , on the eve of elections that stand a real chance of bringing the zionist union to power .. the more than 500,000 settlers in the west bank and east jerusalem have created what may be an irreversible reality , but herzog 's only answer to it is to get back to the negotiation table .. in private circles he mentions five years as the time he needs to conclude the process .. there is no better indication that herzog has no intention of ending the occupation any time soon .. numerous peace plans have already been worked out in great detail ; all that is needed is for one courageous israeli leader to implement any one of them .. herzog , at least at this stage , does not seem to be the one capable of doing this .. on tuesday the " only democracy in the middle east " will elect a new parliament and a new government , in what is frequently described as a celebration of " people power . ". but the reality is that here in israel , it is only the masters who will vote and decide on the future -- not only for themselves , but for the millions of palestinians who have for nearly half a century been living under their control , directly in the west bank and indirectly in gaza .. and yet , it seems , their fate is not a topic worthy of discussion .. to call this a democracy in 2015 is rather problematic .
hong kong ( cnn ) china says its military budget will increase by 10.1 % in 2015 , the latest in a series of double-digit increases that will narrow the still-significant gap with the united states on defense spending .. according to a budget report released at the start of china 's national people 's congress - the annual meeting of the country 's rubber stamp parliament -- defense spending will total 887 billion yuan ( $ 144.2 billion ) this year .. " building a solid national defense and strong armed forces is fundamental to safeguarding china 's sovereignty , " premier li keqiang told thousands of delegates gathered in the cavernous great hall of the people in beijing 's tiananmen square .. the increase underscores china 's intention to prioritize military spending even as economic growth slows .. it also comes amid unease among china 's neighbors about the pursuit of its territorial claims in the south china sea and east china sea .. traditionally , the people 's liberation army army has been focused on protecting its own borders , but recent missions have seen it join u.n. peacekeeping efforts in places like south sudan , and fighting piracy in somalia .. analysts say that china 's spending on defense is notoriously opaque and the budget includes paramilitary forces such as the people 's armed police as well as the people 's liberation army , navy and air force .. paul burton , asia pacific director at ihs aerospace , defence & security , estimates that actual spending is 35 % higher than the announced budget .. " china 's expanding strategic reach and extensive modernization requirements will continue to require significant investment over the next decade , " burton said .. china 's defense budget is still dwarfed by what the u.s. spends on its military -- $ 598 billion , according to 2014 figures provided by ihs .. but , while china 's budget has increased by double digits every year since 2010 , u.s. spending has declined since then .. china 's defense budget grew by 12.7 % in 2011 , 11.2 % in 2012 , and 10.7 % in 2013 , according to china 's state news agency xinhua .. alexander neill , a senior fellow at the international institute of strategic studies in singapore says china is likely to prioritize spending on its naval power -- its force has traditionally been focused on winning land battles .. " a growing chunk of budget is going toward china 's navy , particularly its submarine force and its seaborne nuclear deterrent , " he said .. china 's first aircraft carrier went into service in 2012 and a second is thought to be under construction .. neill also said that the pla is likely to make its pay more competitive to attract higher quality recruits , such as college graduates .. a u.s. congressional report released last month said that many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education .. it added that the country 's one-child policy , which has created the " little emperor " phenomenon of spoiled children , produces recruits who " may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline , " the report added .. " serving in the military , in a chinese cultural sense , is not a sought-after professional career , " neill said .. " if the pla can offer competitive salaries , they may be able to attract a new stratum of specialist talent . ". cnn 's jason kwok designed the graphics in this report .

richard johnson 's striking blue eyes water as bright sunlight floods into the royal box at newbury racecourse and he casts his mind back to a monday night in stratford almost 21 years ago .. ` that was the first time i met him , ' he says .. ` he was a lot skinnier and younger looking , as we all were .. it was my first year as an amateur and his first as a conditional because he 'd been riding on the flat in ireland for a couple of years .. it was towards the end of the season and he 'd already ridden 70-odd winners and i had 10 .. but even before that i 'd heard people saying " this anthony mccoy rode a winner today , he was amazing " .. it takes very little time in the racing world for word to get around .. he was getting horses to win that other people could n't and all the people that you want to be talking about you were talking about him . '. if ap mccoy had been a postman , a plumber or a professor , johnson would probably be talked about as the greatest jump jockey ever .. he has been runner-up 15 of the 19 times mccoy has been champion jockey and that figure will probably be 16 come the end of the season .. johnson 's tally of nearly 2,800 winners far outstrips the totals of giants of the game such as richard dunwoody , john francome and peter scudamore , all of whom won the title at least three times .. richard johnson would be talked about as one of the greatest jump jockeys ever if it were n't for ap mccoy. johnson has finished runner-up to mccoy in the race to be crowned champion jockey 15 times. when mccoy retires at the end of the season johnson , 37 , is favourite to finally achieve his dream but there is no hint of bitterness at the years of playing second fiddle .. ` my main ambition has always been to be champion jockey and ap has been the thorn in my side for a long time , ' he says .. ` but it 's not his fault .. it 's my fault that i have n't ridden more winners than him .. i find it slightly strange when people say , " now he 's retired you can give it a real kick " .. i go for it every day of the week , every year .. i 'll start off the first day of next season as always .. ` obviously without ap it 's definitely going to help but you 've got a host of young jockeys like tom scudamore , sam twiston-davies , aidan coleman and older ones like noel fehily and jason maguire so there 's going to be no easy run of it .

'. at this , johnson chuckles .. ` i 'm not sure about that , i 've just chased him a lot , ' he says .. ` it 's like running with usain bolt , he 's just turning back and laughing as he 's moving away . '. many of the great sporting rivalries of the past have been characterised by sniping and swiping .. but johnson claims there is no room for that in racing , where jockeys know the perils every time they line up at the start and on a more basic level , they have to live with each other day in , day out .. ` the valets set up our gear every morning .. it does n't matter how many winners you 've ridden , it 's how long you 've been riding .. because we started at the same time we 're usually sat next to or near each other .. the longer you 've been there the closer you get to the door .. he 's been pushed out and i 'm going to be next to the door .. cloud creeper ridden by jockey richard johnson jumps the last to win nicol & fielding mechanical services ltd steeple chase at leicester racecourse on friday. mccoy credited pressure from johnson as his motivation for riding so many winners. ` through the winter when we 're racing seven days a week there 's every chance we 'll be at the same meetings for days on end .. i leave home at 4am and get back at 7pm .. i rarely see my children [ willow six , casper three and percy , one ] awake during the winter .. i definitely see ap more than my children and probably my wife , fiona . '. johnson grew up on an arable and cattle farm in hereford .. he rode ponies as a child and as a teenager spent summers working at david nicholson 's yard .. ` he offered me a job when i left school at 16 , ' says johnson , ` i think my parents thought i 'd go for two years , see a bit of life then go to agricultural college and come back and be a farmer . '. he would read copies of the racing newspaper sporting life , now defunct , at breakfast time .. ` peter scudamore was from the same county so i looked up to him , ' says johnson .. ` when i understood racing a bit more richard dunwoody was the man i looked up to .. he 's still someone i look up to today .. even though i 've won more races , to be champion jockey would make me feel i belong in that bracket .

not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than jillian tenen .. the 29-year-old events planner moved to boston from florida two years ago and does n't have any family in town .. when the first of many record-breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in january , tenen was sick with the flu , and did n't dig out her 2007 honda civic .. only the snow did n't stop , and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in bay village .. by the time tenen got her shovel out , it was all-but too late .. ` i 'm 5 ' 2 , ' and it was all ice , an iceberg on top of my car , ' tenen told the boston globe . '. i could n't reach it .. i could n't lift it .. and even if i could , there was nowhere to put it .. i just did n't know what to do . '. after a few laughs , quite a lot of tears , and at lease one breakdown , tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed .. it 's under the iceberg : jillian tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in boston in winter , and after failing to dig out her car , it ended up under this mountain of snow on isabella street in the bay village neighborhood. there it is : recently , some of the ` iceberg ' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear. not again : but with this winter being boston 's snowiest ever , the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried. bleak : jillian tenen 's car is seen parked on isabella street in boston on february 23 , 2015 .. winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of boston 's history. clearing up : jillian tenen 's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow , staying frozen in place at the same on-street parking spot. almost there : by last week - march 12 - and after two months almost , the honda civic was almost ready to escape its cave. : on march 16 , jillian tenen 's was finally back on the road , seven weeks after it was first snowed in. all-smiles , jillian tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on march 18 , and was shocked that it started right away. but after seven weeks , and a heap of chipping , the car has finally freed from its icy cave .. sadly not much could be done about the damage .. the windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up .. there were also deep dents in the roof .. but , surprisingly , the car started on the first go after it had thawed .. tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage .. while she hopes that future winters wo n't be so severe , and will plow her car diligently from now on , she learnt a valuable lesson .. ` if i had to do it again , i would definitely do one thing differently , ' she told the globe . '. i would not park on the corner . '. although the storm did n't cripple boston as previous storms have , it still created a nuisance for snow-weary residents. damage : the weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly , but tenen is filing an insurance claim. many people in the northeastern us had to put on winter boots as winter storm ultima hijacked the first official day of spring. the brooklyn bridge was coated with snow as new york city was hit with yet another snowstorm on friday , march 20. brooklyn residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though friday was the first day of spring. spring arrived on friday , but winter storm ultima ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow. snow will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend. winter storm ultima may have cause more issues for tenen and her car on friday .. although the storm did n't cripple the city as previous storms have , it still created a nuisance for snow-weary boston .. in the city , it 's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after march 20 , weather.com reported .. during the april fools ' blizzard of 1997 , 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed boston .. on friday , ultima led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals. weather.com meteorologist jon erdman said : ` while late march surface temperatures and ultima 's quick movement wo n't make this a blockbuster , some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the new york city and philadelphia metros .. the storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in lynnport , pennsylvania , 6.7 inches at mcguire air force base in new jersey and six inches in cascade , maryland .
i always thought international football was about the best players from one country pitting themselves against the best players from another country .. but this is a fantastical idealistic notion .. the cosmopolitan nature of the world in general , and the easy , frequent movement of large numbers of people from country to country in modern times has made the globe a smaller place .. at the weekend , italy 's equaliser against bulgaria was scored by a brazilian , eder , who first arrived in italy when he was 16 .. he has admitted he does n't know the words to the italian national anthem .. an argentina-born striker , franco vasquez , is also in antonio conte 's squad .. eder , who was born in brazil , celebrates his goal for italy in their euro 2016 qualifier with bulgaria. eder , who moved to italy when he was 16 , has admitted that he does n't know the national anthem. argentina-born franco vasquez is also part of antonio conte 's italy squad. italy 's italian strikers are either too old ( luca toni , antonio di natale ) or out of form ( ciro immobile , mario balotelli , graziano pelle ) , hence the foreign call-ups .. the controversy led to roberto mancini saying that ` the italian national team should be italian .. an italian player deserves to play for the national team , while someone who was n't born in italy , even if they have relatives , i do n't think they deserve to . '. it 's nothing new for italy : they won the world cup in 2006 with argentinian mauro camoranesi in the side .. he moved to italy at the ripe old age of 23 , did n't sing the national anthem , spoke in spanish after the game when he dedicated the victory in the final in berlin to the people back in his neighbourhood on the outskirts of buenos aires -- roughly 7,000 miles from rome .. as if more confusion was needed , he now manages in mexico and his middle name is german .. italy won the world cup in 2006 with the argentinian mauro camoranesi in their squad. roberto mancini , the former manchester city manager , said the italian national team should be italian only. italy 's casual approach to ` italianness ' when it comes to football stretches back nearly 100 years : midfielder luis monti played in a world cup final for argentina in 1930 , and then won the 1934 tournament with italy .. italy of course are not the only ones .. spain called up brazilian diego costa , and england have done it too : raheem sterling was born in jamaica , but there is a difference .. sterling moved to england aged five .. and this is an important point : mancini is wrong to believe you have to be born in the country for which you play : there are circumstances which may lead to you being born in one country , but brought up in another .. the truth is that sterling is proud of his jamaican roots , but feels english .. ` irish blood , english heart ' sang morrissey , summing up the complexity of identity in four words .. diego costa is another high-profile player who was born somewhere other than the country he plays for. raheem sterling was born in jamaica but has lived in england since the age of five. there are plenty of english-born players who feel irish because of their family history -- a father from ireland perhaps .. would it be wrong to deny them the chance to play for ireland ?. back to camoranesi , who even after winning the world cup for italy , said he felt argentine .. italy and spain are stretching credibility with their foreign internationals .. and perhaps the worst of all is gordon strachan selecting matt ritchie .. the bournemouth star admitted he had not even been to scotland before his call-up and debut last week .. he belted out the national anthem like he was one of the proclaimers .. no rules were broken because his dad was born in edinburgh , but how scottish can ritchie feel if at the age of 25 he had failed to make the effort to even visit the country of his father 's birth ?. good luck to him , but the whole mess raises questions about the nature and future of international football .. matt ritchie of bournemouth had never been to scotland before making his debut for them last week. ritchie 's father was born in edinburgh , making him eligible to play for scotland. when one country faces another country on a football pitch , should n't the main purpose of that match be to see how 11 players from one nation fares against 11 players from a different nation ?. is n't that a fundamental premise and prerequisite of international football ?. if it is n't , and the international game has become a free for all involving bending the rules so that it no longer matters where you were born and which nationality makes your heart beat stronger , then what is the point of it .. when i go to see england play against italy i want to see the best english players play against the best italian players .. not a few ringers who are n't good enough to play for other countries .. of course , clinging on to a view that footballers should only play for the country in which they were born will these days lead to accusations of xenophobia or discrimination .. but those accusations are lazy and unintelligent .. international football should always be about one country against another .. there is nothing wrong or racist about that .. but a brazilian playing for spain , an argentine for italy and several englishmen playing for scotland dilutes the passion of the occasion .. it 's become more about players enhancing their careers when it should be about the passion you feel for your country .. and that just is n't right .
a decision over whether to open britain 's first ` new ' grammar school in 50 years has been shelved until after the election , it emerged last night .. the proposal for an ` annexe ' to an existing grammar school in sevenoaks , kent , is currently being considered by the education secretary nicky morgan .. she is awaiting legal advice and was expected to rule on the matter before the election .. but last night a downing street source said : ` i do not think there 's going to be a decision on it this side of the election . '. last month , the prime minister said he strongly supported the right of ` good ' schools -- including grammars -- to grow. and if labour is elected in may then the scheme would almost certainly fail to get the go-ahead .. the tories would probably need an overall majority rather than a coalition to give the plan a chance of being rubber-stamped .. the delay will cause dismay among tory backbenchers and last night threatened to overshadow an announcement the prime minister is due to make today about the government 's flagship free schools programme .. mr cameron will announce that the tories will continue opening free schools -- which are independent of local authority control .. they hope to set up 500 new free schools over the next parliament and 270,000 new school places if re-elected .. mr cameron will go on to say that 49 free schools will open in september , adding : ` if you vote conservative , you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you 've seen in the last three years . '. the proposal for a grammar school annexe comes from weald of kent grammar school in tonbridge which wants to open a campus nine miles away in sevenoaks .. in 2013 the plans were rejected by the department for education on legal grounds .. new grammar schools are banned , but there is backing in the cabinet for expanding existing schools .. and last month mr cameron spoke of his enthusiasm for allowing good grammar schools ` to expand ' , in what was seen as an indication that he backed the new plan .. however the issue is seen as hugely divisive , so it is believed that election chiefs want to avoid it coming up during the campaign .. the education secretary nicky morgan was preparing to give the go ahead to the new school for girls in sevenoaks , kent. the party was previously convulsed by a row over grammars in 2007 .. at the time , mr cameron called them an ` albatross ' , insisting there was a ` hopelessness ' about calling for new grammars .. the party 's europe spokesman graham brady ended up resigning over the row .. last night mr brady said : ` this annexe is clearly wanted by local parents and by kent county council .. ` the bid has been with the department for months and there is no reason why it can not be dealt with immediately . '. free schools raise standards at poorly performing local schools , research has shown .. according to think-tank policy exchange , the increased competition improves results across communities .. george osborne is considering a pre-election tax cut for 27million voters in the budget .. it would increase the amount workers can earn before they begin paying income tax by at least # 200 .. the income tax personal allowance of # 10,000 is to rise to # 10,600 in april .. but the new increase would take thousands more people out of tax altogether and make the allowance almost # 11,000 .. labour treasury spokesman chris leslie said : ` george osborne raised vat and cut tax credits for working people , while giving millionaires a huge tax cut .. this chancellor gives with one hand but takes much more with the other . '. next week 's budget will also give details of a crackdown on loopholes used by multinationals to avoid tax .. it could force firms such as google and amazon to reveal all overseas earnings .

a chelsea fan on twitter - @talkofthebridge -- tweeted recently : ' i dread the day john terry retires more than i dread my own death . '. at first it makes shocking reading , but when you factor in the extreme passion of football fans , the love they have for their club , and the astonishingly high regard chelsea fans have for their captain , it all makes sense .. it should be interpreted in the same way as bill shankly 's famous quote : ` football is not a matter of life and death , it 's more important that that . '. here 's another way of saying it .. chelsea will not be able to replace terry when he finally retires .. england have had to move on already .. but the question remains , how on earth will chelsea cope when the inevitable happens ?. life and chelsea football club will go on of course , but reflecting on yet another incredible man-of-the-match performance from terry at wembley , it occurred to me that he is unique .. john terry and jose mourinho celebrate on the wembley pitch after chelsea 's win on sunday. not so long ago some were declaring terry was finished .. he could n't train properly , we were told .. he could n't play two games in a week apparently .. the truth is very different .. andre villas-boas ' ridiculous high line ensured this over-hyped manager got the worst from terry and made the player look vulnerable .. and then rafa benitez arrived to seemingly finish off the destruction of arguably chelsea 's greatest ever player .. jose mourinho has resurrected the king of stamford bridge .. it is now a major cause for concern among chelsea fans if terry is n't in the starting line-up .. so in playing terms , he is still the first name on the team sheet , even with the likes of cesc fabregas , diego costa , nemanja matic and eden hazard at the club .. but the love for terry among chelsea fans is about so much more than him being a very good centre half .. and that 's why he is seemingly irreplaceable .. terry beat hugo lloris to score chelsea 's crucial first goal in the capital one cup final. the blues captain ran off to celebrate after breaking the deadlock at wembley .... and he led the celebrations at the end as the chelsea players partied after winning the league cup. he came through the youth ranks , and is now a revered chelsea captain .. his team-mates respect him , and they listen to him .. the fans still idolise him .. the football world laughed when he lifted the champions league trophy with his full kit on despite being suspended for that final .. but most if not all chelsea fans understood it .. terry was a huge part of that journey , and in their minds he belonged on that podium , he deserved the champagne , and he deserved to be wearing the shirt that night as the celebrations began .. the cynics and critics will go on and on about terry 's indiscretions -- some alleged , some not .. he 's far from perfect of course , a bit like the rest of us .. and i would n't say chelsea fans do n't care about any of that stuff .. but it does n't hide the fact that when he does decide to retire , there will be a massive grand canyon to fill .. the chelsea captain celebrates after they beat bayern munich to win the champions league in 2012. i 'm not a chelsea fan , so i asked three friends of mine who are to sum it up .. a work colleague , emma , said this : ` he is our rock , our leader , without him we do n't win all those titles and we love him for how much he gives his all to the shirt .. you can imagine cutting him and his blood would spill out blue .. every other fan hates him but knows deep down they would love him in their team . '. another friend , laura used the cliche -- ` mr chelsea ' to describe him , and then went on : ` you can see what the team and the club mean to him .. his reactions after every game , he always comes over to the matthew harding lower and gets the rest of the team over as well to applaud the fans .. a few games ago he signed my shirt , got on the team coach , then got off again and offered a family tickets as he thought he 'd heard them say they had travelled but could n't get in to the game .. it 's a side of him that shows what the fans mean to him and a side that not enough people and media see .

". the galleria mall was not listed on the places durst could go during his parole , said criss , who was a witness at a subsequent parole hearing .. the former judge said police officers told her that durst had also been spotted outside the home where morris black was killed .. a secretary in the district attorney 's office saw durst driving behind the galveston courthouse , criss said .. a condition of durst 's parole was that he could only visit places where his parole officer permitted him , criss said .. his parole was not revoked .. when court officials called durst 's lawyer dick deguerin to inquire about his presence near the courthouse , the lawyer said his client was visiting a psychiatrist in the area .. deguerin could not be reached friday for comment about what criss said about his client .. " there could be no good reason to come back to these places , " criss said .. she started to become concerned .. in " the jinx , " durst described the time he spent living in vermont with his first wife , kathleen , running a health food store in the 1970s .. in 1982 , kathleen mccormack durst went missing .. durst said he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in katonah , new york , and she headed to their manhattan apartment .. her family said they believe she 's dead and that durst is to blame .. the case has never been solved .. durst has denied any involvement in her disappearance .. " it 's a nightmare watching it unfold because you could see that justice is n't going to be done , " criss said of the durst case and its many tentacles .. one day in june 2006 , criss said , that nightmare arrived on a walkway just feet from the doorstep of her home .. " it was part of severed cat and it had been cut right behind the shoulders , " criss said .. " so it had the head and it had the two front legs .. it was a small , pretty little gray cat .. it was placed very carefully .. it was n't just tossed .. it was very neatly laid there .. this had obviously had been killed somewhere else and brought here . ". the animal 's head was perfectly severed .. " what was the key piece of evidence in our case that was n't there that would have given no doubt whatsoever that this was not self-defense -- the severed head , " criss said , referring to morris black , whose dismembered body was recovered but not his head .. criss thought of the two dachshunds she had at home .. she checked and the dogs were fine .. " i was in a panic , " she recalled .. " i was just distraught . ". even the galveston police chief arrived at the scene , criss said .. a veterinarian determined that the cat had been killed by a person .. forensic tests found no dna under the claws .. there was no evidence linking durst to the incident .. " they thought i was paranoid and crazy , that i was overreacting , " criss said .. galveston det. rick mccullor said he was part of the investigation but declined to comment further .. in an email to the bonnie quiroga , head of the galveston office of justice administration , criss talked about getting blinds for her windows and cameras for the courthouse .. she recommended getting the door locks fixed .. cnn obtained a copy of the email .. " his message is he knows where i live ( and ) this is what he is capable of , " she wrote .. criss said she thought about evidence at the murder trial .. the medical examiner testified that the person who dismembered black knew exactly what tools cut through muscle and bone .. then the judge started receiving instant messages from unknown senders .. one said , " did you like your package ? ". criss contacted the fbi , which , she said , for nine months had cameras set up around her home .. criss said agents determined the message was sent from london .. they found no link to durst .. the agent involved in the case did not return requests for comment .. criss started carrying a gun .. her parents always reminded her to keep her doors locked .. " there was a period of time after that where i not only did carry a gun , i had guns and weapons hidden throughout my home , " she said .. " what if he breaks in and the gun is at the other end of the house ?. people did think i was crazy . ". she hid the butcher knives in her breadbox .. " if something happen , i 'd know where they were , " she said .. " i lived like that .. i believe that somebody really bad came to my home to send a message to me . ". criss ' obsession with the durst case is such that she has been working on a book she wants to title " descent into madness . ". the final chapter keeps changing .. " every time you think you 've reached the highest level of weirdness , we go again , " criss said .. she knows more than she needs to know about durst and his peculiarities : how he used to prepare for court sessions in the holding cell doing naked jumping jacks .. how whenever he 's arrested , officers find guns , drugs and stacks of metamucil .. she learned the reason for the last item from listening to 32 hours of durst 's recorded jailhouse phone calls .. " this man , his day , every day of his life , is defined as a success or not a success by how going and doing no. 2 went , " she said .. " that was a part of the conversations with him ... it had to happen at a certain time of day or his whole day was shot .. the court staff used to joke that rearranging the court schedule was going to upset bob 's schedule . ". a few years back , while criss was campaigning for re-election and working the polls , a man approached her .. criss said it was a juror from the durst trial , a man who had befriended the defendant , visited him in jail and dined with him at times .. he must have seen a media report about the severed cat head .. " it seemed like he 's inappropriately happy to be asking me this question -- ` hey , did anything ever happen about that cat head at your house ? ' ". " i 'm thinking to myself : you son of a bitch .. i know the police were n't doing anything about it .. i said , ` oh yes , the police think they know who did .. his demeanor changed and he could n't get away fast enough . "
( cnn ) there have been a few times in my career when i 've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace .. no , i certainly do n't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing " kumbaya " together in the office , but i 'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me was n't , when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be , when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear , anxiety or what have you .. i 'd love to say more about each of the women i 've met along the way who fit those descriptions , but my point is not to single anyone out .. my goal is to ask the question , " why ? ". obviously , not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior , but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up ?. i figured this would be a perfect question for sophia nelson , author of a new self-help book for women called " the woman code , " and she did n't disappoint .. unlocking ` the woman code ' : 4 tips to know your value. " from the time we 're little girls , we 're taught to compete , " said nelson during a recent conversation at cnn .. " i need to be prettier , taller , smarter , my hair needs to be straighter , curlier , whatever it is .. i need to get the better looking guy .. i need to always be better than because we 're taught to come from a place of lack as women . ". the way nelson , an award-winning author and journalist , radio and television personality and motivational speaker , sees it , we women need to start operating like the boys .. men " operate from a sense of , there 's this whole pie , and i want my piece , and i do n't care if he gets his piece , and maybe we even have to work together to start that business , start that company , " said nelson .. of course , it 's easier for a man not to worry " if he gets his piece " since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate america , but that is n't the case for women .. today , just 5 % of s&p 500 chief executives are women and only 14 % of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women , according to a cnn money analysis .. sheryl sandberg teams up with nba to get men to #leanin. decades ago , the situation was even worse .. when i was just starting my television news career in 1990 , women who were in their 40s and were in high-level positions were the only women in a position of influence .. naturally , many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job .. " because they did n't think there could be ten of them , they only thought there could be one of them , " said nelson .. " fast forward 20 years later .. now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms , a number of women in congress .. i could keep going on and on so ... there is a place for more of us . ". which means we can lift as we climb , we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers , says nelson .. " how exactly do we do that ? ". nelson came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other .. first , nelson says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about " who 's in your row . ". " if you hear another woman say , and i 've heard this , ' i do n't do women friends , i do n't have women friends , ' believe her and leave her alone .. i mean that , listen to me now , " said nelson .. there are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women , so do n't invest any time , if possible , with people who do n't , she says .. if you are in a meeting and you have a great idea , do n't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself , said nelson .. " collaborate , share , collaborate .. ... so you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing . ". competition is healthy and we can compete , but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues ' playbook , she said .. " the guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of ' i want the dollars .. i want to win the contract .. i want to get the business . '. we have to get in that same mindset . ". we 're all busy but we 've got to slow down and mentor , said nelson .. " we have to build a bench , " she said .. " men do this well again .. you 've seen it in corporate , i 've seen it .. the guys go out and golf .. they do things together and they 're building up the next young man leader .. whatever field we 're in ... we 're less likely to do it because we 're busy .. we 've got to mentor . ". when you lift other women as you climb , said nelson , you realize it 's reciprocal .. " it 's not all about you . ". we women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations , i added .. " the right women , " said nelson .. " i want to caveat that .. and again , i do n't mean to be mean or catty but ... i know a lot of women in power positions that do n't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do . ". this is a tough one for us , says nelson .. we need to be willing to say to another woman that we did n't like something she did or said and do it in a respectful and private way where we are still building her up , not pulling her down .. " do n't go tell 10 of your friends not to like her .. you 'd be amazed at how silly we can be .. we 're still in kindergarten some of us , " said nelson .. " gossip is still one of the most rampant , nasty things we do as women to each other .. it really damages women . ". why do you think women too often tear each other down instead of help each other in the workplace ?. share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter @kellywallacetv or cnn living on facebook .

the world 's most wanted man avoided a deadly airstrike in iraq thanks to a bureaucratic dispute , it was claimed today .. islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was attending a nursery school in al-qaim on the iraq-syria border , with senior aides and dozens of men set to pledge allegiance to him .. an elite iraqi intelligence unit known as the ` falcons cell ' were aware of this thanks to their sources , and the iraqi air force were ordered to strike the school -- but the defence ministry did nothing .. target : islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi ( pictured ) was attending a nursery school in al-qaim , iraq , with senior aides and dozens of men set to pledge allegiance to him. officials were reluctant to act after the falcons did not reveal their target 's identity - before the office of the prime minister became involved one hour later , reported the sunday times .. however by then baghdadi had left the meeting , and iraqi fighter jets were instead forced to target a moving convoy of vehicles -- not knowing which vehicle he was inside .. one of the cell 's leaders said : ` the strike should have killed baghdadi if it had happened on time , but we were n't able to reveal the target and the fighter jets moved late .

a damning report into one of the nhs 's worst scandals is today expected to reveal up to ten missed opportunities to intervene to prevent poor care .. the independent inquiry will be highly critical of how , despite a string of baby deaths , watchdogs gave an nhs trust the all clear only one month before the last general election .. today 's report is expected to conclude that between 2004 and 2011 there were a series of missed chances to step in at every level , from the hospital to the department of health .. tragedy : joshua titcombe was nine days old when he died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics at furness general hospital , cumbria. up to 30 babies and mothers are thought to have died because of failings by midwives and doctors at furness general hospital in barrow .. investigators are thought to have examined around 50 cases where poor maternity care has been alleged .. the findings will again put labour in the dock over its stewardship of the health service , revealing appalling care over years under the last government .. the official report into care at the unit , run by university hospitals of morecambe bay nhs foundation trust , will paint a damning picture of what went wrong , with echoes of the mid staffs hospital scandal , according to whitehall sources .. former labour health secretary andy burnham was informed about concerns over maternity care at morecambe bay in january 2010 .. up to 30 babies and mothers died at furness general hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors , a damning report is expected to reveal. locally , the alarm was first raised in 2008 when nine-day-old joshua titcombe died on a ward at furness .. an inquest heard midwives and medical staff made ten serious errors that contributed to joshua 's death , including a failure to detect and monitor an infection .. his parents repeatedly asked if he should have antibiotics and complained he was wheezing and not feeding properly .. he eventually died from blood poisoning .. medical charts subsequently went missing and the coroner raised suspicions that they may have been deliberately destroyed .. health officials tried to cover up their failure to investigate poor patient care , it is claimed .. mr burnham , now labour 's shadow health secretary , has repeatedly denied being made aware of ` specific warnings ' about the hospital or putting any pressure on the care quality commission to tone down criticism of the nhs ahead of the 2010 election .. grief : james and hoa titcombe lost their baby son joshua in 2008. but david morris , conservative mp for morecambe and lunesdale , said he was ` surprised and disappointed ' that mr burnham had not been interviewed by the inquiry , chaired by dr bill kirkup , a former department of health associate medical director who also served on an investigation into hillsborough .. ` it 's hard to understand why the inquiry has n't listened to parents who wanted andy burnham to be questioned , ' mr morris said .. ` they should disclose the reasons why they decided not to call him . '. joshua 's father james titcombe , who was appointed to the cqc in 2013 to try to prevent a repeat of such tragedies , is also understood to have protested .. in an email to dr kirkup , seen by the daily mail , mr titcombe wrote : ` i do want to put on record that i am very surprised and disappointed that the investigation has n't interviewed andy burnham .. i have ... raised with you on many occasions , the evidence from people who were working in the system at the time that there was a culture of " no bad news " .. ` i am sure that your investigation must have uncovered issues relating to some of the external , system and national policy issues that impacted on the way people were behaving at the time . '. victims ' families reacted with anger when mr burnham tried to arrange a meeting ahead of today 's findings .. carl hendrickson , whose wife and newborn son died , said : ` none of us were interested .. andy burnham has hidden under a stone for six years .. when labour said they were weaponising the nhs for the election , it made me want to vomit . '. a spokesman for mr burnham said he ` acted entirely properly ' at all times in relation to morecambe bay .. he had volunteered to campaigners the fact that information on maternity care at the trust had been included in an annexe to a wider briefing on issues that might be raised in a meeting with a local mp in 2010 .. a labour party spokesman said : ` the report will dismiss these political allegations and confirm that no labour health secretary was briefed on morecambe bay .. it will instead say that the terrible failings , which span this government and the last one , were very localised . '. an inquiry spokesman said it ` found no evidence that would have required an interview ' of mr burnham .
( cnn ) farah fled the civil war in syria with her husband in the middle of the night , hitching rides on trucks until they finally crossed into jordan .. two days later , she gave birth to a girl in a country where they hold no status .. like 70,000 other refugees from syria , iraq , sudan and the palestinian territories , farah ( her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity ) now lives with her family in zarqa , a poor jordanian city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks .. men dominate public spaces , and many women stay at home , isolated .. two years ago , farah was a nurse and her husband a lawyer .. here , he found work tiling construction sites , but was arrested three times for working illegally .. " now my husband stays at home , depressed and afraid of being sent to the camps , " farah said .. she is now the family breadwinner , working at a local organization providing educational programs to syrian and jordanian children .. every day she navigates the dangers of zarqa 's crime-ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men .. yet zarqa is also a pocket of hope .. some 384 female refugees working with the near east foundation have been able to re-establish savings , restore dignity , strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives .. many of them choose to become earners for the first time .. they belong to a network of jordanian and refugee women -- coaches , mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support , exchange tips and build friendships .. some 80 % of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home-based business .. fatiya , who escaped iraq during the 2003 invasion , was surviving on charity until six months ago .. now she runs her own leather goods home-based business , making belts , wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home .. these days , fatiya is busy rebuilding her life .. " i make my own way , " she says .. zainab , also an iraqi refugee , is now a hairdresser in zarqa .. on the side , she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women , walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent .. on march 8 , we celebrate international women 's day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who , like farah , fatiya and zainab , continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination , creativity and skill , despite increasingly limited options .. aid agencies must match the strength of these women 's resilience .. to truly assist them , we must empower them with opportunities and choices .. of the 10.5 million refugees registered with unhcr , the un 's refugee agency , less than 1 % are eventually resettled .. the rest remain in limbo , forced to forge new lives in places where they often have no right to work .. refugees are displaced for an average of 20 years , and more than half disappear into urban sprawls where they struggle to integrate and start their lives over .. humanitarian assistance and media attention tend to fixate on " immediate " aid -- distribution of cash , food and subsistence items .. unhcr provides critical cash assistance to refugees in jordan -- but this can be as little as $ 71 a month , 16 times below the country 's poverty line .. refugees need to supplement their allowances , yet they can not legally find employment , and working in the informal sector can be dangerous .. farah , fatiya and zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy .. but their increased role as earners challenges cultural norms , exposing them to heightened abuse and violence .. women 's ability to generate income does not guarantee economic independence .. to help this network of women control the income they earn , the near east foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives ' and daughters ' newfound roles .. " in the beginning , these women were tremendously shy -- they did n't talk , " says hamdan eliemat , who heads the bani hasan islamic society , a community organization supporting the women .. " and now they wo n't stop talking .. and we men , now we have to listen . ". the international community must advocate for refugees ' right to survive .. we must ensure that beyond immediate aid , women have access to skill-building , financial resources , social networks and protection from violence and harassment , so they have the chance to build their own futures .
a mother-of-one has argued that parents should be doing more to teach their children about sex following the news that pupils as young as 11 will be taught the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools .. education secretary nicky morgan said the proposed lessons ( which schools and parents can choose to opt in to ) will better prepare pupils for life in modern britain .. the question over whether such lessons are appropriate led to a heated debate on today 's this morning as two women appeared to share their opposing views .. mother-of-one sonia poulton shared her views on modern parenting on today 's this morning , pictured. mother-of-one sonia poulton , 50 , a journalist from london , argued that the onus should not be on schools to teach children such issues around sex education .. rather , she believes parents should be taking much more responsibility .. she said : ' i think it 's entirely inappropriate the kind of conversations we are allowing strangers to have with our children .. if anybody needs to be having sex education lessons it 's parents .. ` children are becoming sexualised earlier and there is plenty a parent can do .. first of all , start parenting again .. parents have handed their children over to computers and smart phones to raise them .. they have taken their foot off the pedal and that is the issue .. ` children are seeing " pop porn " from rihanna and nicki minaj and we need to be telling children in schools - if anything at all about sex education - that 's it 's about relationships and respecting yourself .. anna williamson , 33 , a childline counsellor , believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex. ` we are thrusting them into this sexualised world when we do n't need to . '. she added on the issue of teaching the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools : ` we should not be normalising this for children .. i am an open-minded mum and i sexually educated my daughter because i am the safest person to do it . '. however , tv presenter anna williamson , 33 , from london , who is a childline counsellor , said she believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex education .. she said : ` the key word about this is age appropriate .. it 's not about storming into a classroom and giving children a barrage of information that as adults we find difficult to take in .. ` it 's gently starting that conversation and getting schools on board and parents taking responsibility too so it 's a three way conversation .. ` we know at childline that there is a deficit ( in sex education ) between the ages of six and 11 so these children do n't have the tools and the know how - or where to ask for help - or to know what is wrong . '. she said that having a proper syllabus is vital to keep children safe and to stop them being misinformed and then spreading myths about sex in the playground .. under morgan 's proposal , pupils are to be taught from the age of 11 about the difference between rape and consensual sex .. the two women debated the issue raised by education secretary nicky morgan with tv presenters phillip schofield and amanda holden. the lessons , which could come in as soon as after the easter holidays , will be based on a series of resources being developed by the pshe association .. writing in the sunday times to mark international women 's day , the conservative mp said : ` we have to face the fact that many pressures girls face today were unimaginable to my generation and it 's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they 'll face in adulthood .. ` our commitment to supporting women should start long before they take home their first wage .. we have to ensure that the education girls receive not only allows them to reach their academic potential , but also prepares them for life in modern britain . '. the recommended materials , which she has stressed will be age appropriate , are aimed at giving teachers more confidence and better guidance to teach difficult subjects .. the sex education lessons will be based on a series of resources being developed by the pshe association. nicky morgan has said ` it 's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they 'll face in adulthood '. thousands of this morning viewers took to the show 's facebook page to join in the debate .. carla pointing said she agreed with anna 's points and welcomes the move to change sex education in schools .. she wrote : ` think that 's a great idea .. in an ideal world it would n't have to happen at all but it 's good to educate children on the difference and make them aware in an age appropriate way .. ` i 'd be more than happy for my child to be taught about this at school . '. toni greenacre also believes it 's a good idea .. she said : ` they should be taught that anything under the age of 16 is wrong too .. if they do n't know , then how will they speak out about it ? '. but samantha roythorne thinks 11 is too young for children to be taught about rape .. she said : ' 11-year-olds should not know what sex is .. you can protect your children from horrible people without going into detail . '. i would be mortified if my daughter found out what sex was at that age !. sex is for adults not children ! '. leanne marie christie agreed saying she thinks the proposal takes away childhood innocence .. she said : ` how can an 11-year-old process the feelings and emotions that go along with this conversation , we moan about the state our country is in yet we give children responsibilities and emotions they ca n't deal with and wonder why they are stressed , self harming and having mental health problems it 's ridiculous !. they are only children for a short time lets let them be innocent !

google users will have the right to sue the internet giant in british courts over its ` clandestine ' tracking of their browsing , the court of appeal has ruled .. a group known as safari users against google 's secret tracking want to take legal action in the english courts over the way google tracks users of apple safari 's internet browser .. they accuse google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and to target them with personalised advertisements .. the group believes a landmark ruling in their favour now opens the door for litigation by millions of internet users .. ruling : google users will have the right to sue the internet giant in british courts over its ` clandestine tracking of their browsing ( file picture ). three judges have dismissed google 's appeal over a high court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information .. today 's ruling was a victory for safari users , including editor and publisher judith vidal-hall , and robert hann and marc bradshaw , who are both it security company directors .. they say google 's ` clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and early 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among uk users .. they accuse google of collecting private information without their knowledge and consent by the use of ` cookies ' - a small string of text saved on the user 's device .. dan tench , a partner at law firm olswang , which represents the group , is quoted by the times the landmark ruling potentially ` opens the door for litigation by millions of british apple users ' .. he said the case decides ` whether british consumers actually have any right to hold google to account in this country ' .. mr tench added : ` this is the appropriate forum for this case - here in england where the consumers used the internet and where they have a right to privacy . '. a group of internet users want to sue google , claiming the internet giant secretly tracked their browsing habits in order to bombard them with targeted adverts .. the claimants , known as safari users against google 's secret tracking , all used apple 's safari browser and have accused google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts .. google was accused of misuse of private information , breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws. they say that cookies , small tracking files , were installed by google on the apple computers and mobile devices of those using the safari internet browser without their knowledge .. cookies are used by advertisers , and owners of other websites , to target advertising based on an individual 's internet use .. the campaigners also say that google 's ` clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among uk users .. the claimants accused google of misuse of private information , breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws .. the appeal judges unanimously ruled that misuse of private information was a tort - a civil wrong - for the purposes of the rules governing service out of the jurisdiction , enabling legal action to go ahead .. they also clarified the law on the meaning of ` damage ' in section 13 of the data protection act .. lord dyson , master of the rolls , and lady justice sharp said in their joint judgment , with which lord justice mcfarlane agreed : ` on the face of it , these claims raise serious issues which merit a trial .. ` they concern what is alleged to have been the secret and blanket tracking and collation of information , often of an extremely private nature ... about and associated with with the claimants ' internet use , and the subsequent use of that information for about nine months .. ` the case relates to the anxiety and distress this intrusion upon autonomy has caused . '. three judges have dismissed google 's appeal over a high court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information. the appeal judges said mr justice tugendhat , who heard the case in the high court , was entitled to come to the view that it was ` clearly arguable ' that article 8 ( right to private life ) of the european convention on human rights was engaged and gave weight to allowing the claims to proceed .. the judges also said google inc had estimated its trial costs at # 1.2 million , which seemed ` extremely high ' and they could be controlled by the court 's management powers .. they said some of the technical issues in the case may already have been addressed by litigation against google in the us over the safari issue .. in august 2012 google had agreed to pay a civil penalty of $ 22.5 million ( # 15.1 million ) to settle charges , brought by the united states federal trade commission that it misrepresented to users of the safari browser that it would not place tracking cookies or serve targeted advertisements to those users .. in november 2013 it also agreed to pay $ 17million ( # 11.4 million ) to settle us state consumer-based actions brought against it by the attorneys general representing 37 states and the district of colombia .. after the latest ruling , a google spokesman is quoted by the times as saying : ` we 're disappointed with the court 's decision and are considering our options .

a crystal with a ` forbidden symmetry ' that was once thought to be impossible to form naturally has been found .. the so-called quasicrystal was discovered in a 4.5 billion-year-old meteorite in a remote region of northeastern russia .. and studying it could help scientists find out how mysterious materials like this formed in the universe .. scientists at princeton university , new jersey studied an ancient meteorite ( shown ) and found a quasicrystal with a structure that it was once dubbed ` impossible ' .. it was thought such material could not naturally occur in nature because the crystal has a symmetry in which atoms should n't form. the discovery was made by a team from princeton university , and is the second natural quasicrystal ever found - both in this meteorite .. prior to the team finding the first natural quasicrystal in 2009 , researchers thought that the structures were too fragile and energetically unstable to be formed by natural processes .. ` the finding of a second naturally occurring quasicrystal confirms that these materials can form in nature and are stable over cosmic time scales , ' said dr paul steinhardt from princeton university .. on the outside , quasicrystals are solid minerals that look like quite normal , but it is their inner structure that fascinates scientists .. instead of the regularly repeating clusters of atoms seen in most crystals , quasicrystals contain a more subtle and intricate atomic arrangement involving two or more repeating clusters .. as a result , a quasicrystal 's atoms can be arranged in ways that are not commonly found in crystals , such as the shape of a 20-sided icosahedron with the symmetry of a soccer ball .. the difference between crystals and quasicrystals can be visualized by imagining a tiled floor : tiles that are six-sided hexagons can fit neatly against each other to cover the entire floor .. but five-sided pentagons or 10-sided decagons laid next to each will result in gaps between tiles .. the team published the findings in the journal scientific reports .. dr steinhardt said the discovery raises the possibility that other types of quasicrystals can be formed in nature .. quasicrystals are very hard , have low friction , and do n't conduct heat very well - making them good candidates for applications such as protective coatings on items ranging from airplanes to non-stick cookware .. the newly discovered quasicrystal , which is yet to be named , has a structure that resembles flat 10-sided disks stacked in a column .. this type of structure is impossible in ordinary crystals , in which atoms are packed closely together in a repeated and orderly fashion , earning it the ` forbidden symmetry ' moniker .. ` the structure is saying ' " i am not a crystal , but on the other hand , i am not random either , "' dr steinhardt said .. crystals with these ` forbidden symmetries ' had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr steinhardt and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal , now known as icosahedrite , in a rock that had been collected years before in chukotka , russia .. on the left , the top panel shows the symmetry of the first natural quasicrystal called icosahedrite .. the lower panel shows the symmetry of the recently discovered quasicrystal , which has not yet been named .. right is the ordered yet non-standard pattern of the quasicrystal revealed by an electron beam. crystals with these ` forbidden symmetries ' had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr steinhardt and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal , now known as icosahedrite , in a rock that had been collected years before in chukotka , russia ( shown ). the researchers confirmed that the quasicrystal originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about 4.57 billion years ago - around the time our solar system formed .. they published those results in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in 2012 .. ` bringing back the material and showing that it was of natural origins was an important scientific barrier to overcome , ' dr steinhardt said .. this new quasicrystal was found in a different grain of the same meteorite and has 10-fold , or decagonal , symmetry .. it is made up of aluminum , nickel and iron , which normally are not found together in the same mineral because aluminum binds quickly to oxygen , blocking attachment to nickel and iron .. the researchers confirmed that the quasicrystal originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about 4.57 billion years ago , which is around the time our solar system formed ( artist 's illustration shown ). the researchers are now exploring how the mineral formed .. ` we know there was a meteor impact , and that the temperature was around 1,000 to 1,200 degrees kelvin , and that the pressure was a hundred thousand times greater than atmospheric pressure , but that is not enough to tell us all the details , ' said dr steinhardt .. ` we 'd like to know whether the formation of quasicrystals is rare or is fairly frequent , how it occurs , and whether it could happen in other solar systems .. ` what we find out could answer basic questions about the materials found in our universe .

elon musk has revealed two key software updates for the tesla model s sedan that he claims will end ` range anxiety ' .. the first is a ` range assurance ' app that communicates with tesla 's supercharger network , warning drivers if they are about to run out of power , and pointing them to the nearest supercharger .. the second is a trip planner , which will combine the supercharger network with the network of model s cars to improve long-distance journeys for drivers .. tesla 's software will map out the best route to a driver 's destination based on the location of charging stations .. it will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge. tesla 's updated software will map out the best route to a driver 's destination based on the location of charging stations .. it will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge via a trip planner app .. the update will also add several safety features , including automatic emergency braking and blind spot detection .. in the future , the tesla model s fleet will also have auto-steering and the ability to summon a car to any location .. ` this makes it effectively impossible for a driver to run out of range unintentionally ' , said musk .. ` you 'll have to confirm you want to , actually .. the model s is already able to estimate how much charge a driver has left in their battery .. it can also tell the driver where they are from the nearest supercharger .. superchargers are free connectors that charge model s in minutes .. there are currently 403 supercharger stations with 2,219 superchargers around the world .. the latest update combines these two features , to provide more accurate warnings .. its built-in trip planner , meanwhile , will be more advanced , using real-time data such as wind speed and elevation .. the announcement follows musk 's cryptic tweet over the weekend , in which he hinted at the 6.2 software update that will be available later this month .. the separate range assurance feature should be available in the u.s. , europe , and most of china within the next 12 months .. other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the model s , which should be available in the next three months .. ` we can basically go between san francisco and seattle without the driver doing anything , ' musk said .. other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the model s , which should be available in the next three months .. the technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel , acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway .. the car will be able to sense its surroundings. the technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel , acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway .. in the future , the company will also give driver 's the ability to summon their car to any location .. the model s will also get automatic emergency braking and side collision warnings with the new update .. the updates today addresses one of the biggest concerns for owners of electric cars ; that their battery could run out at any moment , leaving them stranded with no recharging station nearby .. so-called ` range anxiety ' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of tesla 's model s vehicle .. the model s is already able to estimate how much charge a driver has left in their battery .. it can also tell the driver where they are from the nearest supercharger .. the latest update combines these two features , to provide more accurate warnings. elon musk ( left ) said that owners should expect such important software updates to be delivered to their tesla model s once every three or four months .. on the right is a preview of what the trip planner will look like. in a survey for consumer reports in 2012 , 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars .. the official range of the model s at the moment is up to 310 miles ( 500km ) , which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers .. running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past .. earlier this month ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining , it bases its predictions on your unique driving style .. the myford mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house .. the app was announced at mobile world congress in barcelona and currently works with a selection of ford 's electric and hybrid cars .. cnn noted that , last year , tesla upgraded its tesla roadster electric car , increasing its range from 245 to 400 miles ( 395 to 645km ) on a single charge .. this was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and , at the time , musk tellingly tweeted : ` should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the model s , but it obviously * will * happen long-term . '. musk has since deleted that tweet - perhaps in anticipation of today 's announcement .. tesla regularly updates drivers ' software for free over the air .. in january , for instance , an update increased the speed of the top-of-the-line p85d via use of ` insane mode ' - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph ( 97km/h ) in 3.2 seconds , compared to the usual 5.9 seconds .. ` we 've designed the model s to be basically a computer on a wheels , ' musk said .. ` we view in the same way you view updating your phone and your laptop . '. musk added that owners should expect such important software updates to be delivered to their tesla model s once every three or four months .. the announcement follows musk 's cryptic tweet over the weekend , in which he hinted at the 6.2 software update that will be available later this month

with robin van persie not due to return for manchester united until next month , if ever there was a time for radamel falcao to prove his worth at old trafford then it is now .. unfortunately for manager louis van gaal it appears that falcao 's surprise selection for united 's under 21s in a 1-1 draw with tottenham on tuesday has done little to repair the shattered confidence that has characterised the 29-year-old 's loan spell .. van gaal confirmed on friday that van persie will not be fit until after the forthcoming international break and although he insisted his decision to play falcao in the second string was not intended to humiliate the player , he hinted that the plan may not have worked .. radamel falcao was dumped in manchester united 's under 21s team on tuesday night vs tottenham. falcao did not manage to get on the scoresheet against tottenham hotspur 's under 21s and was poor. united boss louis van gaal says falcao 's demotion was in order to boost his confidence. van gaal was speaking at united 's pre-match press conference on friday ahead of their clash vs tottenham. 6 - louis van gaal could oversee an unwanted milestone on sunday , as tottenham look to make it six games unbeaten against manchester united .. 1921 - the last time spurs managed this was a century ago , when they won four and drew two games either side of world war one , between february 1914 and october 1921 .. 3 - if spurs win it will be the first time they have had three consecutive victories at old trafford .. 1 - if tottenham manage at least a draw , they will become the first team to go six games unbeaten against united in the premier league era .. ` people wrote that it was humiliation to play him in the second team .. but a lot of players have played there this season .. ` so i do n't think so .. it just shows a professional attitude of the manager , the staff and the player .. ` victor valdes also played and rafael da silva .. rafael played a very good match and scored a very good goal so he will now have a better grip on his confidence .. ` that can happen to all the players playing in the second team .. it 's a lower level and they can play more than the 70 minutes they get in training .. ` falcao did not play his best match for the second team but he tried and he did his utmost best . '. i can not ask for more from him .. he has shown a professional attitude .. ` we pay a lot of money for the players and so it is normal that they play football for us .. falcao has not reacted to this the way the media has reacted .. that 's the difference . '. robin van persie has been sidelined since sustaining an ankle injury against swansea on february 21. falcao tries to escape from spurs u21 duo bongani khumalo ( left ) and grant ward ( right ) on tuesday. more than seven months after signing the player , van gaal is still unable to fathom why he has been unable to replicate the stellar form he showed for colombia , porto and atletico madrid .. ` you never can know that , ' van gaal said when asked why things had not worked out for the 29-year-old , whom united have an option to buy for # 43.2 million at the end of the season .. ` we are looking for the solution for him but you can never know that .. ` you can give fantastic performances in another country but not in the country that you are present for .. ` that is not the first example and it will not be the last example .. a lot of players need more time to adapt to the new situation , new culture , higher rhythm of the english game and to a lot of aspects . '. the striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at old trafford - including in their last two games. falcao has started the last two games on the bench and van gaal does not appear to be in any kind of rush to recall the striker .. ` in a club like manchester united it is more difficult than in a minor club because here he has his competitors , ' van gaal added .. ` now wayne ( rooney ) is playing there and wayne is scoring so you always have to compare players with each other but you need also luck .. ` he is doing his utmost best and shows a professional attitude , not only falcao but all the other players , but you can not always win . '. with falcao only boasting four goals for united this season , van persie 's absence continues to hurt van gaal and his team .. asked about the dutch striker 's possible return against tottenham tomorrow , he said : ` no , he is still with the medical department .. he 's training inside , not outside on the pitch .. it will be the other side of the international break . '. van gaal won a trophy in his first season at ajax , bayern munich and barcelona , but the chances of him doing so at united are remote .. falcao celebrates scoring against leicester , one of only four goals he has netted for united since joining. the 2-1 defeat by arsenal knocked united out of the fa cup on monday and in the league , van gaal 's men are 10 points behind chelsea , who have a match in hand .. united are fourth in the standings , just one point ahead of liverpool , with 10 matches left .. van gaal is sure his team 's confidence has not been affected by the cup exit to the gunners . '. i have the same confidence as before , ' said van gaal , who has fixtures against chelsea , manchester city and liverpool after saturday 's home game against tottenham .. ` we were very disappointed at the last game because the players had the feeling that we lost ( because of ) ourselves and not ( because of ) the opponent .. ` but i am very pleased with the reaction from the players this week and i hope we can show that against tottenham because it is the first of 10 matches we have to play in the rat race .

new figures show childhood obesity rates double while children are at primary school , with one in five leaving primary school obese. one in 10 children are obese when they start primary school at the age of four , shocking new figures have revealed .. and in the space of five years , childhood obesity rates double , with one in five children leaving primary school obese .. experts today warned that not enough is being done in schools to tackle the childhood obesity epidemic , urging the government to increase compulsory physical activity levels .. the new figures , published today by the health and social care information centre , show 9.5 per cent of reception class children , aged four to five , were obese in 2013-14 .. it marks a slight rise from 9.3 per cent the previous year , but is lower than in 2006-07 , when 9.9 per cent of the age group were obese .. in year 6 , the proportion of 10 to 11-year-olds who were obese was 19.1 per cent in 2013-14 , up from 18.9 per cent the previous year , and also a rise from 17.5 per cent in 2006-07 .. tam fry , spokesman for the national obesity forum , said while the ` adult population seems to be getting the message ' , with rates remaining largely constant in men and women , childhood obesity is the ` real concern ' .. he told mailonline : ` the huge doubling between children aged four and 11 is particularly disastrous . '. mr fry warned by the time children reach 11 it is ` recognised they have more or less made up their minds about their lifestyle ' .. ` those 11-year-olds are probably going to end up as obese adults , ' he said .. ` it means every year there will be more and more obese adults adding to these statistics . '. he said in scotland the nhs has been forced to re-evaluate its obesity forecast figures , predicting that 50 per cent of the nation will be obese by 2030 - 20 years earlier than previously estimated .. ` we used to think we 'd be retired and buried by 2050 , ' he said .. ` but 2030 is a whole generation earlier . '. while acknowledging the forecast is currently only specific to scotland , mr fry said it is a concerning trend .. mr fry , who is also chair of the child growth foundation , told mailonline the blame for spiralling primary school obesity rates , in part , lies with a failed education programme .. he said the current scheme , introduced by labour and pursued by the coalition government , ` is n't working ' .. ` one of the reasons for these high rates of obesity by the time a child is 11 is a lack of physical education , ' mr fry told mailonline .. ` children are just not getting enough exercise . '. he rejected the tendency of politicians to lay blame solely at the door of parents , noting the period where child obesity rates rise is when they are in primary school - and so spending the majority of their time away from home .. and he warned an added concern is not knowing how children are spending their pocket money at corner shops and on their way home .. experts say the exercise programme in schools ` is n't working ' and today called for the government to introduce more pe lessons into the curriculum ( file picture posed by models ). ` if only schools were to have proper physical activity , these numbers would reduce significantly ' mr fry said .. ` there must be an absolute requirement to bring physical education back into mainstream school activity .. ` parental responsibility is always the quick response from government .. ` but in fact once a child goes to school they are outside parental responsibility for a great amount of the day .. the pe and sport survey , conducted in 2009-10 , found 55 per cent of pupils in years one to 13 participated in at least three hours of high-quality pe and out-of-hours school sport each week .. sixty-four per cent of pupils in primary schools reached that level of exercise each week .. the guidelines , introduced in 2011 , state children aged five to 18 should be at least moderately active for at least an hour every day .. sixty minutes is , however , just a minimum and children and young people should in fact be active for several hours each day .. for the first time in 2011 , the chief medical officers in the uk published guidelines for children under the age of five .. those able to walk unaided should be active for at least three hours a day , spread throughout the day .. ` schools should take over that responsibility both in terms of teaching the child , and their wellbeing and welfare , but that is plainly not happening .. ` the government has really got to up the focus on physical activity for children at school and in pre-school . '. but action to tackle childhood obesity rates can not stop there , mr fry argued .. he said in light of statistics revealed at the weekend , that show hundreds of babies born each year are classified as obese , the focus must also be on informing women of the dangers of being overweight or obese at conception .. ` making sure females of child bearing age understand their responsibilities to the next generation is vital .. ` if a woman is overweight or obese at conception , it is most likely her baby will be obese from the moment it is born . '. he added : ` there is a huge amount of work to be done . '. today 's figures do reveal childhood obesity has fallen from its peak of 19 per cent in 2004 and 2005 .. the hscic said the latest data is ` not statistically significantly different from those over the last three or four years ' .. eustace de sousa , national lead for children , young people and families at public health england , said : ` overall childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010 , however for children from the poorest households levels have continued to worsen so there is no room for complacency .. ` we know that almost one in 10 four to five year olds are obese ( 9.5 per cent ) and by age 10-11 this doubles to nearly one in five ( 19.1 per cent ) .. ` obese children are more likely to experience bullying , low self-esteem , anxiety , depression and have a higher risk of becoming obese adults and developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease as a result .

'. i would not describe the number of emails as large , but they did have the occasion to email each other , ' white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters .. the national security agency technician who was in charge of the team that built president barack obama 's specialized blackberry , dickie george , said it 's unlikely the president ever said anything to clinton over email that could be seen as damaging if exposed .. ` he 's actually very security conscious ... there 's no , absolutely no , chance that he put anything sensitive in those emails , ' george told politico .. still , bruce brody , a former chief information security officer at the department of energy who is now oversee secuirty at cubic global defense , cautioned that even the most innocent of conversations between clinton and obama could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands .. ` there 's more intelligence in casual conversation than you might think , just because he 's the president of the damned united states , ' baker told the publication .. a q and a document sent to reporters by clinton 's staff after the former state department official 's tuesday afternoon briefing with the press asserted that ` robust protections were put in place ' by the secretary and updated as needed .. yet it did not say what those were , citing concerns that ` people with ill-intentions ' would attempt to break into her security system , which clinton says was set up her husband , bill , a former president , and guards the private communications of both him and his aides .. the nine-page document disclosed , however , that third-party experts were consulted .. it did not name names .. chris soghoian , principal technologist at the american civil liberties union told politico that unless clinton ` was paying a team of people to keep her personal email secure , it 's likely it was less secure , ' however .. the state department , he pointed out , has a full-time security team and the national security administration at its disposal .. ` it was on property guarded by the secret service , and there were no security breaches , ' clinton said at a press conference. south carolina republican rep.trey gowdy , head of the task force that ' s investigating the 2012 benghazi terrorist attack to determine what knowledge the state department possessed - if any - that could have prevented the assault , said tuesday afternoon that clinton should be required to turn over the server for inspection .. she also needs to answer lingering , ` serious questions ` about the security of the system she employed , ' he said in a statement , and ` who had access to the server from the time secretary clinton left office until the time -- almost two years later -- the state department asked for these public records back . '. gowdy also wants access to the server to determine if any of the more than 30,000 personal emails clinton says she got rid of because they were not related to her work at the state department can be retrieved .. clinton says gave the state department copies of all her work-related emails , yet ` without access to secretary clinton 's personal server , there is no way for the state department to know it has acquired all documents that should be made public , ' gowdy said .. the former obama administration official said tuesday the server will remain out of the government 's grasp , however .. ` no one wants their personal email made public , and i think most people understand that and respect that privacy , ' she told reporters while explaining her decision to toss emails she did n't think were pertinent to national security .. should clinton change her mind and give the government unfettered access to her private property chester wisniewski , senior security adviser at canadian computer company sophos , says its possible that anything she tried to destroy may still be on the server .. ` if the emails were on a server in her house and she deleted them , there 's a chance the emails could still be on the server 's hard drive if you forensically examine it , ' he told the new york times .. ` to make sure the emails are really destroyed , you would have to physically destroy the hard drive , which many companies and places like the defense department often do . '. reporters flooded the united nation 's headquarters on tuesday to listen to former secretary of state hillary clinton answer questions about her use of a private email system while serving in president barack obama 's cabinet .. a q and a document sent to reporters after the briefing asserted that ` robust protections were put in place ' by clinton and updated as needed. another concern of government officials is that clinton deliberated classified information via her personal email address , which is against the law .. she says she did n't .. ` classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office , ' the statement from her office distributed on tuesday said .. but a former senior state department official who worked in the diplomatic core of the government before her told the new york times that clinton 's claim is dubious . '. i would assume that more than 50 percent of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified , ' he said .. ` was every single email of the secretary of state completely unclassified ?. maybe , but it 's hard to imagine . '. even if clinton did confer with her colleagues about classified topics over email , ` there 's zero chance that she 'll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information , because she decides what 's classified , ' steven aftergood , director of the project on government secrecy at the federation of american scientists , told the times .. the secretary of state , he said , has the highest classification authority at the department and the power to dictate what is and is n't restricted .
the leader of the muslim group who defended isis executioner mohammed emwazi has sparked further outrage after he refused to condemn the stoning women .. asim qureshi , the director of cage , was last night quizzed about extremist positions advocated by muslim scholars - including female genital mutilation , domestic violence and stoning as a punishment for adultery .. but mr qureshi , appearing on the bbc 's this week programme , failed to speak out against the practices - while also defending the right of muslims to wage jihad .. it comes after he defended the london-raised fanatic emwazi - unmasked as the infamous fanatic ` jihadi john ' - as a ` beautiful , kind man ' .. asim qureshi , the hard-line leader of the muslim rights group cage , which defended isis executioner jihadi john last week , has sparked further outrage after repeatedly refusing to condemn the stoning women. pressed by andrew neil , the show 's presenter , to condemn a series of extreme positions , including claims that jews are descended from pigs and homosexuality is evil , mr qureshi responded ` i 'm not a theologian '. 2006 : ` when we see hezbollah defeating the armies of israel , we know where the solution is and where the victory lies .. ` we know that it is incumbent upon all of us , to support the jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the west .. february 26 , 2015 : mohammed emwazi was an " extremely gentle , kind , beautiful young man ' .. he was " extremely kind , extremely gentle and the most humble young person i ever knew " .. march 3 , 2015 : ` what we want is to understand whether or not the security agencies , their actions , led to him feeling like he does not belong to uk society .. we never said there is a direct causality . ". march 5 , 2015 : " jihad is part of the religion of islam .

'. mr neil accused mr qureshi of advocating jihad and sharia law .. mr qureshi responded : ` as far as i am concerned , sharia law is n't practised correctly anywhere in the world .. jihad is part of the religion of islam . '. he repeated his criticism of mi5 and the security services , claiming they helped to radicalise young muslim men by mistreating them .. former home secretary alan johnson said his remarks showed ` what we are up against in terms of the ` moderate front ' .. the exchange came after london mayor boris johnson accused mr qureshi of being an apologist for terror .. mr qureshi last week described london-raised fanatic emwazi -- accused of being the infamous ` johadi john ' in the isis beheading videos - as an ` extremely kind ' and ` extremely gentle ' man who had been radicalised as a result of harassment by security agencies .. the cage research director said he believed the approach taken by the agents was ' a factor in the reason why he felt like he did n't belong in the uk any more ' .. mr johnson responded : ' i really , really think that the focus of your indignation and outrage should be on people who go out to join groups that throw gays off cliffs , that behead people who do n't subscribe to their version of islam , that glorify in the execution of innocent journalists and aid workers .. mr qureshi -- who last week described the british fanatic mohammed emwazi unmasked as jihadi john , as a ` beautiful young man ' -. ` these should be the object of your wrath , not the security services who are trying to keep us safe . '. mr qureshi , 33 , has revealed the he became ` anti-white ' at the # 18,000-a-year whitgift school in croydon , south london , which he attended as a child .. the controversial campaign chief was born in britain to pakistani parents and -- thanks to his mother 's ice-cream business -- was sent to 400-year-old whitgift .. jihadi john 's sister is ` living in fear ' after receiving death threats , a close friend said today .. student shayma emwazi , 23 , has been tracked and abused on facebook , forcing her to close her account .. she and the rest of emwazi 's family are now living under police protection in a secret location after mohammed emwazi was unmasked as jihadi john .. a friend of shayma told the evening standard : ` they are struggling to live a normal life .. ` shayma came back from holiday not too long ago to all of this drama which occurred overnight .. she does not deserve to be blamed for her brother 's evil actions .. ` the only thing she and mohammed have in common is that they are blood , but she is not a terrorist . '
it 's a pivotal policy for the federal government but questions are being asked of the prime minister 's understanding , or lack thereof , around metadata after his bizarre claim that he never worried about police looking into his , when he was a journalist .. the problem with his attempt to allay fears of the modern day media is that metadata was hardly a player when tony abbott was reporting in the 1980s and early 90s , before the advent of the internet .. ` in the days when i was a journalist there were no metadata protections for journalists , ' he stated to a gathering of reporters on wednesday .. but if you do the math , his argument simply does not stack up .. i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister said .. his writing career ended before the internet began. while metadata does include some traditional methods of investigation ; including phone numbers and length and time of calls , the overhaul 's main thrust is aimed at computer based functions , particularly the online and email world .. the internet came to be , effectively , in 1992 .. full text searches were not available for two years after that and email access came to being about the same time .. by then , tony abbott was well and truly ensconced as press secretary to opposition leader dr john hewson , his days as a writer for the bulletin and the australian all but over . '. i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister said . '. a contested warrant is more like a court case and if you had to have a court case to access metadata , well , the whole process would absolutely gum up , ' he said .. in trying to explain the planned two-year retention , mr abbott has previously stated that he believed metadata to be the ` sites you 're visiting ' .. ` it 's not what you are doing on the internet , it 's the site 's you are visiting , it 's not the content it 's just where you have been .. ` it 's the person you are sending it to , the person sending it , it 's the date and the place it 's posted from . '. federal labor had earlier agreed to support new metadata laws with amendments .. the government bill , which is expected to pass parliament by the end of next week , forces telecommunications companies to keep two years of customer data , such as the time and length of a phone call .. the laws would allow for warrant-less access by government agencies .. the government has agreed to a number of labor amendments , including better protections for journalists .. australian press council chairman david weisbrot , has expressed his concern the laws could crush investigative journalism and dissuade whistle-blowers from coming forward . '. a healthy democratic society requires robust free speech and a free and vigorous press to hold governments and other powerful interests to account , ' he said . '. i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister told the canberra media gallery. metadata is the footprint left by electronic communications .. the worry for journalists is that sources might be hesitant to come forward knowing that metadata could lead investigators to their door .. ` these are not hypothetical concerns , ' professor weisbrot said .. he said governments were increasingly chasing down leaks and stripping away whistle-blower protections .. ` these legitimate concerns can not be addressed effectively short of exempting journalists and media organisations . '. attorney-general george brandis had previously said that in a ` newly dangerous age ' it was vital that those protecting australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed. a parliamentary committee recommended in february the laws be passed , but called for safeguards for journalists .. it recommended the issue of protecting journalists ' sources be referred to a separate inquiry to report to parliament within three months .. attorney-general george brandis had previously said that in a ` newly dangerous age ' it was vital that those protecting australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed .. the government wants the regime legislated this month .

the conclusion of a football match , particularly monumental ones like the world cup final , often brings new debate and inquiry , questions about players , tactics and refereeing decisions .. very rarely do they result in a government investigation .. yet that is exactly what happened after brazil 's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts france .. quite what transpired in the hours before the match , particularly with star player ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off , is one of football 's most enduring mysteries .. ronaldo pictured following brazil 's 3-0 defeat by france at the 1998 world cup final at the stade de france. ronaldo looks gutted after the loss as he was not himself in a final where the pressure seemed to get to him. france vs brazil in the 1998 final led to a government investigation about ronaldo 's involvement. france : barthez , thuram , desailly , leboeuf , lizarazu , deschamps ( c ) , karembeu , petit , zidane , djorkaeff , guivarc ' h. goals : zidane ( 27 , 45 +1 ) , petit ( 90 +3 ). booked : deschamps , karembeu , desailly. brazil : taffarel , cafu , aldair , baiano , carlos , sampaio , dunga ( c ) , rivaldo , leonardo , bebeto , ronaldo. venue : stade de france , saint-denis. civil action in a rio court , a rio medical council action against two team medics ( both of whom were unanimously absolved of blame ) and an investigation in brazil 's national congress have shed some light on the events of july 12 1998 but it continues to be a source of consternation in the country .. the official records show the match ended in a 3-0 defeat for brazil but the story of what happened in and around the stade de france that afternoon is murkier in detail .. ronaldo , then just 21 , had been outstanding all tournament in a brazil side - including cafu , roberto carlos and bebeto - that were defending their title from 1994 .. the final was billed as a head-to-head between him and france 's equally captivating talisman zinedine zidane .. in the event , the france midfielder steamrollered a jaded brazil outfit , scoring two first half headed goals in a man of the match performance with emmanuel petit adding a third after a late counter-attack .. it was the first time france had been crowned world champions but it later transpired much of the drama had already happened , out of view of the many millions of tv viewers worldwide .. the day had began in a relaxed fashion for the brazil players .. the whole squad had lunch at the chateau de grande romaine , just outside paris then returned to their rooms .. ronaldo was sharing with roberto carlos , neighbouring a room with edmundo and doriva .. france 's zinedine zidane sees his header go through the legs of brazil 's roberto carlos in the final. france celebrate after going 2-0 up as midfielder zidane steamrollered a jaded brazil outfit. france players celebrate with the world cup trophy as they won the great competition on home soil. france manager aime jacquet holds up the world cup trophy and is surrounded by the world 's media. zidane was a worthy winner of the world cup as he brushed aside brazil with two goals in the final. roberto carlos implied ronaldo was wilting under the weight of expectation of the nation .. ` he was scared about what lay ahead , ' he said , ` the pressure had got to him and he could n't stop crying .

a new tax by the european commission could see 80 per cent of small cider producers affected. four out of five british cider makers would be put out of business after a new ruling by the european commission .. the uk government was formally told last week to change its current excise duty , which means cider makers that produce less than 70 hectolitres ( 12,000 pints ) a year do not have to pay duty .. changes to the 39-year-old exemption is likely to affect 80 per cent of britain 's 480 cider and perry makers , according to the national association of cider makers ( nacm ) .. in a statement , the european commission , said it was ` unanimously agreed ' that the uk excise duty scheme contravenes eu legislation .. it said : ` eu excise duty rules oblige member states to levy an excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages .. ` there are no provisions which would provide for an exception to the general obligation to levy excise duty in respect of cider and perry made for sale by small domestic producers .

'. tuc general secretary frances o'grady said : ` soaraway pay at the top has been matched by zero-hours contracts and big real-wage falls for staff across higher education . '. last year , ministers said they had serious concerns about the ` substantial upward drift ' of salaries and that university leaders should show ` much greater restraint ' .. uk universities are independent institutions but they receive public grants , and students receive government loans to pay tuition fees .. ucu asked 155 uk universities and colleges a series of questions about vice-chancellors ' pay packages , including benefits and pensions , as well as money spent on air fares , hotel accommodation and personal expenses , for the year ending july 31 last year .. around 16 per cent - 24 institutions - did not respond or cited exemptions and did not release the requested information .. the findings show that the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was # 260,290 based on data from 150 institutions .. the average expenditure on flights for university leaders , with information from 128 universities , was # 9,705.75 .. the most was spent by the london school of economics and political science ( lse ) , which paid out # 59,811.14 on flights for director professor craig calhoun .. overall just over two-thirds of air fares were for first or business class , ucu said , according to data from 114 universities .. the average spend on hotel accommodation during 2013/14 was # 3,202.05 , based on data from 122 institutions .. the most was spent by glasgow caledonian university for professor pamela gillies at # 27,271.13 .. the average received by vice-chancellors in personal expenses was # 3,112.61 , according to information gathered from 125 universities .. the highest amount - # 33,526 - was given to professor gavin henderson of the royal central school of speech and drama .. richard bullock , chairman of nottingham trent university 's board of governors , said : ` former vice-chancellor professor neil gorman received a 2 per cent salary pay rise in his final year as vice-chancellor .. ` the additional monies reported in this year 's financial accounts were paid under a scheme that was instigated in 2008 to operate over a five-year period .. ` this scheme was put in place by the board following independent , external advice , at a critical time in the university 's strategic development which required continuity of leadership .. ` the board were keen to retain professor gorman for this five-year period following a very successful initial five years . '. he added that monies accrued annually were subject to meeting clear terms , with accruals declared each year .. an lse spokesman said : ` a key part of the director 's role at lse is to maintain the array of international relationships and establish new links with universities , businesses and non-governmental organisations around the world .. ` inevitably this involves a significant amount of international travel .. none of this travel is in first class . '. a glasgow caledonian spokeswoman said : ` gcu is the first scottish university to open a campus in london and it established the uk 's first campus in new york in 2013/14 , with further key partnerships in bangladesh , oman and south africa .. ` this has inevitably required extended trips to our overseas locations and having increased costs .. the university is transparent about expenses incurred .

dozens of cheap and popular california wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic , claims a new lawsuit filed this week .. sutter home , korbel , franzia and trader joe 's charles shaw white zifandel , also known as ` two-buck chuck , ' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe .. twenty-eight california wineries were listed in the complaint , which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question .. a new lawsuit claims dozens of cheap and popular california wine , including franzia and trader joe 's charles shaw white zifandel , are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic. the lawsuit was filed by four individual southern california wine consumers who , according to their attorney brian kabateck , had 1,306 wines tested at a denver-based laboratory and then confirmed results with two additional laboratories .. kabateck said 83 wines , almost all of which sell for below $ 10 a bottle , contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water .. the environmental protection agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard .. ` this is a very serious public health concern , ' kabateck said .. ` we would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately . '. ` if not voluntarily , we would ask the court to do it . '. the united states does not have a set standard for safe levels of arsenic in wine , according to the san francisco chronicle .. the lawsuit claims 83 of the 1,306 wines that were tested contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water. but wines are allowed to have arsenic levels up to 100 parts per billion in canada - and other countries allow even higher levels .. the wine institute , an advocacy group for california wineries , called the lawsuit ` misleading ' and ` false ' .. according to institute spokeswoman gladys horiuchi , california wines have never come close to exceeding the arsenic levels that are accepted in other countries , she told the associated press .. in a release statement , the institute said arsenic was ` prevalent in the natural environment ' and that ` no research ' had found the amounts in wine to ` pose a health risk to consumers ' .. the lawsuit specifies the wines contained ` inorganic arsenic , ' which is more toxic than the arsenic found naturally in the environment .. chronic long-term consumption of inorganic arsenic can cause cancer , as well as liver and kidney damage .. but a number of wine producers have fought back at the lawsuit and said they plan to contest the claims .. a trader joe 's spokesman said the grocery store chain had ` no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe , including charles shaw white zinfandel ' .. korbel said the lawsuit was ` without merit , ' adding that the company plans to challenge the allegations .. the 83 bottles of wine cited in a lawsuit this week as having dangerously high levels of arsenic came from 28 california wineries and were bottled under 31 different brand labels .. some of the labels included several different types of wine .. acronym ( gr8rw red blend ). almaden ( heritage white zinfandel , heritage moscato , heritage chardonnay , mountain burgundy , mountain rhine , mountain chablis ). arrow creek ( coastal series cabernet sauvignon ). bandit ( pinot grigio , chardonnay , cabernet sauvignon ). beringer ( white merlot , white zinfandel , red moscato , refreshingly sweet moscato ). charles shaw ( white zinfandel ) .. colores del sol ( malbec ). glen ellen by concannon ( glen ellen reserve pinot grigio , glen ellen reserve merlot ). concannon ( selected vineyards pinot noir ). corbett canyon ( pinot grigio , cabernet sauvignon ). fetzer ( moscato , pinot grigio ). flipflop ( pinot grigio , moscato , cabernet sauvignon ). franzia ( vintner select white grenache , vintner select white zinfandel , vintner select white merlot , vintner select burgundy ). hrm rex goliath ( moscato ). korbel ( sweet rose sparkling wine , extra dry sparkling wine ). menage a trois ( pinot grigo , moscato , white blend , chardonnay , rose , cabernet sauvignon , california red wine ). mogen david ( concord , blackberry wine ). oak leaf ( white zinfandel ). r collection by raymond ( chardonnay ). richards wild irish rose ( red wine ). simply naked ( moscato ) .. smoking loon ( viognier ) .. sutter home ( sauvignon blanc , gerwurztraminer , pink moscato , pinot grigio , moscato , chenin blanc , sweet red , riesling , white merlot , merlot , white zinfandel )

he is the protege of total football mastermind rinus michels , but ` little general ' dick advocaat has been pitched straight into battle at sunderland .. in nine games there will be little time to roll out the revered brand of football which won fame and acclaim with the ajax and holland teams of the 1970s .. instead , the 67-year-old is tasked with saving a failing side from relegation .. then , successful or otherwise , he will be gone .. but who is the man who , at 67 , is making his premier league debut as sunderland 's oldest-ever manager ?. dick advocaat ( left ) in action during his playing days for roda against psv eindhoven. advocaat on a cycle ride when assistant coach with holland in 1987 - seen here with adri van tiggelen , ronald koeman , rene van der gijp and marco van basten. advocaat has held many managerial positions both in his native holland and abroad - see here at psv eindhoven in 1996. advocaat is best remembered in great britain for his two league titles with rangers in the late 1990s. advocaat certainly does n't want for experience .. this is the 18th job of a 28-year managerial career which has taken in nearly 900 matches and yielded 10 major trophies .. he is best known on these shores for three-and-a-half years at rangers , a stay which produced two spl titles -- including a record 21-point winning margin -- two scottish cups and a league cup .. advocaat , though , has since been accused of reckless spending -- a claim he defends -- and it was at ibrox that he splashed out a club record # 12million for chelsea striker tore andre flo .. that name alone is enough to cause alarm among followers of sunderland .. for they paid rangers # 6.75 m for the norwegian after a relatively successful two years north of the border .. video sunderland appoint advocaat as manager. there will be a few familiure faces in the premier league for advocaat .. he has worked with and against ronald koeman in holland. manchester united manager louis van gaal is another manager that advocaat knows well. former england , manchester city and leicester boss sven goran eriksson is someone else that advovaat knows from his time in the game. successful , however , is not a word used to reflect on his time at the stadium of light and , after four league goals in 29 appearances , he left on a free transfer .. that , of course , is not advocaat 's fault and there will be no scope for new additions during his time on wearside , should the flo connection cast doubt over his judgment .. rather , it will be his ability to make a snap judgement on those already in residence which will determine his legacy with the black cats .. he is certainly well remembered at the likes of psv and zenit st petersburg , where in 2008 his domestic champions beat former club rangers in the final of the uefa cup , a triumph which won him honorary citizenship of the russian city .. working with premier league players will not be new to advocaat as he has come across many in his time in international football - including manchester united 's marouane fellaini while he was coach of belgium between 2009-10. former arsenal star andrey arshavin is another player advocaat has worked with during his time as russia manager between 2010-12. advocaat signed brazil international giovane elber for german side borussia monchengladbach in 2005. during his first spell in eindhoven in the mid-nineties he lifted the dutch cup and eredivisie title , working with the likes of brazilian striker ronaldo .. his second stint in 2012 saw the club finish second in the league and lose in the cup final , but a win ratio of 65 per cent equalled that of his initial tenure and still stands as the best of his career .. were he to win six of nine matches with sunderland then it would perhaps eclipse everything he has achieved .. but there have been rocky times , too .. advocaat has nine games left in the premier league season and his aim is to ensure sunderland do n't go down. despite his years of managerial experience , advocaat has never been in a relegation battle before. he was hounded from his second spell as holland national-team boss after both the media and supporters were critical of his handling of the team , despite them reaching the semi-finals of euro 2004 .. ten years earlier he took holland to the last eight of the world cup but was on the brink of losing his job before the finals in the usa after a fallout with star player ruud gullit , who retired from international football in protest .. subsequent posts at south korea and russia saw his teams fail to emerge from the group stages of world cup 2006 and euro 2012 respectively , while his latest job was an unhappy five-month period in charge of serbia , where he was sacked in november .. despite his origin as a pupil of michels , advocaat has been criticised for playing defensive football with too much emphasis on structure and discipline .. however , on the evidence of sunderland 's shambolic 4-0 defeat to aston villa on saturday , structure and discipline is probably the best place to start .

a warning , an ` education ' notice , and a final notice .. ` the code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action .. often consumers share with flatmates , partners , or family , which means that even those who do n't download illegally could be taken to court , ' ms turner told daily mail australia .. foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups. 55 % of australians who downloaded content illegally , including breaking bad spin-off better call saul ( above ) said it was because of a lack of access. the communications alliance , the industry body backing the proposed code , released a statement last week emphasising the ` public education ' elements of the code , but noted that the scheme did provide a process of ` facilitated preliminary discovery ' .. in australia , piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of game of thrones .. unlike in new zealand , australia has no limit to fines under the copyright act , and it is up to the judge 's discretion as to what the consumer is fined .. choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they do n't resort to illegal content .. ` we did a survey last year which found that a third of australians download illegally , and more watch the illegal content , ' said ms turner .. ` when we asked people the reason they downloaded , 55 % said it was because of a lack of access , and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources , ' she said .. ms turner said that 55 % of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources. ` consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online , but that they are blocked from accessing it .. it makes very little sense to them . '. the code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which ` include continuing efforts of rights holders to ensure timely and ready availability to australian consumers of lawful content alternatives . '. however , ms turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as stan available in australia , the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed .. choice is calling on communications minister malcolm turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code , and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy .

tony blair has insisted he was right to let hundreds of thousands of eastern european migrants move to britain .. the former prime minister said it was not a ` mistake ' to open britain 's borders to eight former communist countries in 2004 , despite the decision being criticised by the labour leader ed miliband .. mr miliband said the former pm had ` got it wrong ' when he allowed people from poland , hungary and the czech republic to work in britain without restrictions .. tony blair has insisted he was right to let hundreds of thousands of eastern european migrants move to britain. britain was almost alone in the eu in not imposing transitional controls to slow the rate of migration .. the decision to allow freedom of movement into britain sparked a mass wage of migration - with around 170,000 eastern european migrants moving to the uk every year .. mr miliband said the party under mr blair ` became too disconnected from the concerns of working people ' .. the labour leader has pledged to ban immigrants from claiming benefits for two years and to tackle rogue employers exploiting migrant labour .. but mr blair said political leaders needed to stand up and defend freedom of movement in europe .. he said the only way to defeat ukip and other anti-immigration parties was to expose their ` ridiculous ' plans .. labour leader ed miliband said mr blair had ` got it wrong ' when he allowed people from poland , hungary and the czech republic to work in britain without restrictions .. mr blair said migrants would have come sooner or later even if transitional controls had been imposed .. he said : ' i do n't agree it was a mistake .. all we did was bring forward what would have happened anyway .. in 2004 the economy was booming and we had a requirement for skilled workers from abroad .. ` supposing you put all those people from eastern europe back out of britain again would we be a stronger better country ?. the answer is no .

'. i mean , you have just got to put the argument .. she probably would n't agree and she might vote for someone else as a result . '. political leaders have a ` duty ' to say that ukip 's proposals to end free movement are ` ridiculous ' , he said .. he said : ` if britain wrenched itself out of the european union , this idea that nigel farage would go off - can you imagine anything more ridiculous than the idea that he would negotiate a bespoke agreement between britain and the european union ? '. i mean that would be an interesting negotiation to be a fly on the wall on . '. ` i 'm not saying you do n't have to deal with it with a real understanding of the anxieties that people have but your job as the leader is to say ` well , look , this is where i think we should go .

terry gibson is sitting in a restaurant in wimbledon , recalling the 12 absurd and wonderful chapters of his life that were spent in this part of town .. ` it was nuts , ' he says .. ` you did n't need fash and jonesy to lie about what went on -- the reality was mad enough . '. in time , gibson will come back to the sore point of how the wimbledon side of the eighties was represented in a recent documentary .. terry gibson laughs whilst recalling his eventful spell playing for wimbledon 's crazy gang. he will address the myth that the crazy gang was ruled by the bullying of john fashanu and vinnie jones , even if there is a memory of the former stripped to his underpants and covered in baby oil ahead of a dressing-room fight .. but , for now , gibson wants to laugh rather than seethe .. the little striker , who won the cup , once told alex ferguson where to go and pocketed # 200 for scouting pablo zabaleta , wants to present a fuller picture of life at plough lane .. ` i remember dennis wise , ' he says .. ` just after we won the fa cup in 1988 players were getting sold and he was desperate for bobby gould to give him a big move .. we went on a trip to sweden and he 's bought a load of fireworks .. back at the hotel , wisey is letting them off from the fifth floor into a crowded street .. the locals are running for cover .. bobby knew he was trying to force a move and would n't budge .. just another day at wimbledon . '. the wimbledon players celebrate having won the 1988 fa cup at wembley against favourites liverpool. gibson poses for the camera when speaking to sportsmail 's riath al-samarrai about his career. ` there was a time when fash was telling the newspapers he was getting threatening letters at the training ground , ' he says .. ` we all knew it was rubbish so one day i cut out letters from a newspaper , like in the films , and spelled , " meester fash , we are watching your every move " .. i slipped it in his pocket and when he found it he starts panicking .. he disappears with his big mobile phone and the next day 's papers say fash has had another threat .. he always was a drama queen . '. gibson adds : ` my first day at the club , i saw wisey pinching the volkswagen badge off vinnie jones 's dad 's truck .. vinnie was panicking that his dad was going to kill him .. ` there were a lot more laughs than people might have thought based only on the documentary . '. john fashanu , in action during his wimbledon playing days , was certainly a character in the crazy gang. gibson , like most associated with the programme , the crazy gang , has taken exception to claims from fashanu that he was ` the leader ' and ruled by fear .. ` the truth is we tolerated fash , ' says gibson , who spent six years at the club .. ` he was a bit of a clown .. he was the perfect player for us but he always tried to present himself as something he was n't , even then .. ` yes , you had to be very tough to survive at the club .. but there was so much more to how wimbledon achieved what we did .. for fash to imply he controlled our dressing room with intimidation is just false .. ` of course there were fights but fash exaggerated .. jonesy told the story about fash locking the dressing room and throwing an unnamed player against a bench and splitting his leg open .. gibson was former team-mate lawrie sanchez 's assistant at wycombe , northern ireland and fulham. ` the lad was robbie turner and , as i remember it , fash strips to his pants and covers himself in baby oil .. they slipped around a bit and no punches were thrown .. yes , robbie badly injured his calf on the bench but it was not split open with blood everywhere .. ` the stories were all embellished .. it was no mafia , it was more a boarding school of very naughty boys . '. a deeper perspective is found in gibson 's new book , giant killer .. it 's a wonderful autobiography , self-written across three years .. the book charts his rise from tottenham , to coventry , to manchester united and on to the high points at wimbledon , before gibson became lawrie sanchez 's assistant at northern ireland , fulham and wycombe .. the 52-year-old , in action for wimbledon ( right ) works for sky sports , commenting on spanish football. ` the game changed a bit in those three decades , ' he says .. ` when spurs signed me as a kid they offered my parents a holiday and i was hoping they would choose somewhere abroad -- they asked for this camp in dovercourt !. at least the club sent a limo . '. it was at coventry that gibson played alongside sam allardyce and stuart pearce .. ` we went to bisham abbey once , ' gibson says .. ` pearce and micky adams were sharing and ashley grimes was in with sam .. we 'd all had a drink one night .. ` somehow micky and pearcie got into the others ' room at something like 3am and tossed all their gear in the courtyard .. sam and grimes go to fetch it but get locked out in the rain .. god , they were out there for maybe an hour .. sam was getting all this abuse , pearcie and micky calling him a northern so-and-so and laughing at him , saying , " no wonder millwall got rid of you " .. wimbledon players in training during the crazy gang era with fashanu ( centre ) and vinnie jones. ` next thing there is a huge crash .. sam has found a fire extinguisher and thrown it through their window .. i can still hear sam saying , " oh s *** .. i did n't mean it .. after three good years at coventry , gibson joined manchester united for a difficult 18 months , in which he repeatedly felt ` belittled ' by ron atkinson .. ` you could see the glow of his sunbed from the training pitch , ' gibson says .. ` he just picked on me for reasons i never understood . '. at one point , gibson pulled out of a move to watford because he correctly anticipated atkinson would be sacked and a fresh start might await .. atkinson 's exit meant alex ferguson 's arrival .. ` alex was always honest with me -- a good man , ' gibson says .. ` i got the hairdryer once after a reserve game and told him to shove it all up his a *** .. gibson endured a difficult 18 months at manchester united ( left ) and was brought to wimbledon in 1987. ` the next morning i went to apologise and he said he admired my spirit .. i liked him but it never worked out for me at united . '. gould brought gibson to wimbledon in 1987 -- the manager allegedly ate 12 sheep testicles to get sam hammam to sanction the move -- and his playing career re-started .. ` i could have done a book on wimbledon alone , ' he says .. in retirement gibson went on to form a fine coaching partnership with sanchez at northern ireland , which included capping jonny evans from united after ` my son realised from playing championship manager on the computer that he was eligible for us ' .. gibson has detailed his eclectic career in a book called giant killer , which is available at terrygibson.london. in a career of surreal moments , it seems about right .. there was also a # 200-a-week scouting position for manchester city in spain that saw him recommend zabaleta .. ` the club did ok out of it , ' he says .. these days the 52-year-old commentates on spanish football for sky and is happy to be out of the thick of it .. ` i think i 've had probably enough of that craziness in my life , ' he says .. terry gibson 's book giant killer is available at www.terrygibson.london
a photographer has delved into the decaying bowels of the new york subway system and emerged with incredible shots of its abandoned tunnels .. gregory berg , 21 , was enticed by the metro transit authority 's empty stations and now regularly walks across live tracks to take his stunning glimpses of underground gotham .. the subway 's third rail famously carries 625 volts of electricity and touching it means likely death for new yorkers who do n't listen to announcements reminding passengers ` do not go on to the tracks for any reason ' . ". death is a serious option down there , ' mr berg told daily mail online .. however , he prefers taking risks in the subway 's less crowded corners to safely riding along in busy cars and has been venturing down to the system 's unseen parts for two years .. gregory berg , a 21-year-old photographer in new york city , regularly makes his way into the deep abandoned corners of the metropolis 's subway system. the urban spelunker said that his favorite type of shot is where trains create a blur of light as they go past empty stations like the one above. mr berg ( pictured ) goes down onto the tracks of the subway , but makes sure to be careful and avoid touching the third rail , which carries 625 volts of electricity. some abandoned platforms , such as the unused area underneath 42nd street 's ace train stop , are within earshot of conversations happening at active stations. the urban photographer , who grew up in manhattan and new jersey , would not disclose how he reaches the abandoned platforms , though doing so often requires going on to live in-use tracks where speeding trains come every couple of minutes .. his destinations are often within earshot of active stations , and he said that he can hear conversations on the 42nd street ace platform when he is on an unused platform directly below it .. other spots are only reached by long walks on tracks underground .. he acknowledged that what he does is ` very illegal ' and said that he would never go shoot the tunnels without friends .. mr berg first met up with a group of underground photographers when he was 19 after seeing one of their pictures on instagram .. his father was a model train enthusiast and now trains continue to be part of his life as he goes around the city with friends such as james lanning .. the snappers regularly receive requests to help hopeful urban explorers reach hidden spots of the subway , which mr berg calls ` the bando , ' but does n't offer help to those who do n't know what they are doing and seriously hurt themselves .. the skilled snapper said that while he may one day shoot commercial photography , though right now he is just focused on sharing his experiences in new york. the photographer said that visitors to the subway tunnels can emerge with their hands and teeth covered in dirt despite not having touched anything. the photographer is not interested in internet fame , but uses his instagram as a means of sharing his photos with like-minded people and creators. there is also ` another world ' of graffiti artists and urban explorers who use the same tunnels for adventure , though some do not like photographers sharing photos of their secret spots. he has also had close encounters with workers in the subway , and one time narrowly escaped an abandoned platform before an employee with a flashlight called over a group of his coworkers to the spot mr berg had been minutes before .. beyond the dreaded third rail and police , there is always the threat of an approaching train in stations that cars still run through without stopping .. he said that fear of the subway 's scarier side is ` only mental ' .. ` the senses are always raised ; listening for trains , inhaling the scents of the city , the brain works fast and unimpeded , ' he shared on instagram .. mr berg , who was homeless four years ago and is now sober after recovering from addiction , said that the adventures and the thrill he gets from his underground photography ` saved his life ' .. his website houses mementos his bravery , including many shots looking down the barrel of tunnels from which trains will shortly emerge .. he said that people , especially new yorkers , need to see a different side of their city . '. i just want to share my wild experiences with the world , and captivate the city with some truly great people-something photography is perfectly suited for . '. catching blurs of light from passing trains is his favorite type of shot .. he said that he is in no rush to make more money by doing commercial photography , even though he has received offers to shoot weddings that could be lucrative .. for now mr berg continues with the less glamorous realities of what he calls his job .. he said that the subways were ` the dirtiest place you 've ever been , ' with the constant possibility of stepping on dead rats and more live rodents than you could imagine from looking at the critters scurrying around on active tracks .. mr berg hopes his work lets new yorkers , and people at large through social media such as instagram , see a different side to the metropolis. some hidden parts of the new york city subway system , which has been operating for more than a century , are only reached by long walks. mr berg said that his ` brain works fast and unimpeded ' when he is down on the tracks and that the fear of oncoming trains or electric shock is ` only mental '. the 21-year-old has had close encounters with getting caught after workers with flashlights suspected that someone was up to ` very illegal ' activity. the tunnels are stifling hot in the summer and can become cold in the winter , though they are always capable get visitors dirty even without them touching anything .. often his hands and white smile are tainted black by dirt when he emerges after a night of shooting , often in the early hours of the morning .. when people hear about mr berg 's photos they often ask if he has seen the ` mole people ' who live in the tunnels , though he does n't believe they exist .. the strangest thing he has ever seen in the train system 's death is a hole in the wall that spurts out water , but will suddenly fire out 500 cigarette butts in repeated intervals .. his expertise with the subway has led more than 5,000 users to follow him on instagram , but he says that the social network is an outlet to express himself and meet others with similar vision rather than achieving internet fame .. he is drawn to the underground because it is ` truly beautiful down there ' and that his work has completely changed the way he feels when he rides the subway normally .. mr berg often rides between subway cars ( also very dangerous and illegal ) to find unused tracks that will lead to more hidden underground gems .. new york city 's subway has dozens of closed stations and platforms in addition to more than 400 active ones .. the most famous abandoned station is the former city hall stop in lower manhattan , mr berg 's favorite .. it was designed by architects heins & lafarge and still boasts the tiled archways and chandeliers it had before it was closed at the end of 1945 , and very few have gotten to see its beauty up close since .. the station sometimes has tours where it is lit up , but mr berg prefers to shoot as it is , with minimal light and the blur of passing by with hundreds of unsuspecting passengers who will soon take the stairs back to the world at street level .. while mr berg has also shot photos dangling his toes from skyscrapers dozens of stories up , he says there is nothing that compares to exploring the underground .. ` you would never believe what 's right below you 're feet , ' he said .. the photographer once found a hole in the wall that would spit out water punctuated by bursts of 500 cigarette butts at a time. mr berg often rides between subway cars , which is illegal and dangerous , to find unused tracks that may lead to the city 's hidden gems. the new york city subway has more than 400 active stations , but there are more that have fallen out of use since the system began in the early 20th century. mr berg has also shot photos dangling his toes from skyscrapers dozens of stories up , he says there is nothing that compares to exploring the underground and finding new places. mr berg ( pictured ) said that the city beneath his feet is ` truly beautiful ' and he hopes to ` captivate the city with some truly great people '

freddy ovett describes himself as ` 50-50 ' british and australian , though the soft queensland accent seems a giveaway .. it is n't quite as simple as that , because freddy is the son of steve , 1980 olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of british sport , whose rivalry with sebastian coe captivated a global audience .. three decades on , freddy is forging his own path -- but as a cyclist , not a runner , having switched sports 18 months ago and made such rapid progress that he has trained with chris froome , the 2013 tour de france winner , and recently signed with france 's top development team .. cyclist freddy ovett is all smiles as poses for a picture with his former athlete father steve ovett. ovett jnr spent his first seven years in dumfriesshire , where his parents moved after steve 's retirement , and where his father competed in the odd cycle race until he collided with a car in 1994 -- by coincidence , the year freddy was born .. freddy knows little about his father 's brief cycling career , and laughs as he says : ` i can imagine him rocking up , thinking he was stronger than anyone . '. but he knows everything about his running : ` my depth of knowledge about the history of athletics is more than my dad 's .. i have to correct him sometimes on what he did and did n't do . '. freddy and his father steve hit the running track , somewhere steve is very familiar with. father and son are cut from the same cloth .. ` we 're so , so close , and so similar , ' he says .. that augurs well for freddy and badly for opponents , since the older ovett , now 59 , was famously competitive .. he was equally famously prickly with the press -- a trait that does n't seem to have been inherited by the genial , open ovett jnr .. had social media existed in the 1980s , it 's difficult to imagine steve asking a journalist to publish his twitter handle ( it 's @freddyovett , since you ask ) .. freddy recently signed with france 's top development team after swapping running trainers for a bike. freddy was a promising middle-distance runner , just like his dad , and in 2012 won a scholarship to the university of oregon .. then he suffered a knee injury .. ` it was so frustrating .. i came back to australia and did a bit of cycling to keep in shape , ' he says .. tests at the victorian institute of sport suggested he had promise .. ` i think i was meant to be a cyclist all along , ' freddy says .. ` i always followed it , i was always staying up to stupid hours watching the tour de france .. it fascinated me , despite the scandals .. i was a big fan of lance armstrong before the whole downfall . '. medals : 800m olympic gold , 1500m bronze ( 1980 ) ; 1500m european gold ( 1978 ) ; 800m european silver ( 1974 , 1978 ) ; 5,000 m commonwealth gold ( 1986 ) .. ran a 3:48.8 mile in 1980 to beat seb coe 's record. battled with coe for the mile record in 1981 -- it changed hands three times in nine days. set three 1500m records between 1980 and 1983. set a two mile record in 1978 that lasted nine years. ovett was also bbc sports personality of the year in 1978. what did his father make of him turning his back on running ?. ` when i started cycling , we were n't speaking , ' says freddy .. ` it was a strange time , it lasted about a year , which was tough on both of us . '. his parents are divorced and while his mother is still in noosa , queensland , his father lives down in melbourne with his new partner .. ` when i went to europe last year , my dad and i got back in contact , ' freddy continues .. ` he sees the way athletics is at the moment and he saw how difficult it was for me to break through .. ` he 's super supportive about my cycling -- and excited more than anything .. when i speak to him i can sense that . '. freddy has a lot to live up to if he wants similar levels of success as his father steve. one of the challenges in athletics , says ovett jnr , is dealing with doping , which -- surprisingly -- he thinks is worse in his original sport than in his new one .. ` cycling has taken more of an aggressive approach in trying to stamp it out , ' he claims .. ` in athletics , a lot of dodgy stuff is going on that the general public are not aware of , because they 're not knowledgeable enough . '. freddy , 21 , is based in chambery in the alps , in an apartment owned by his new team , ag2r .. they are as french as cycling teams come , but manager , vincent lavenu , a top rider in the 1980s , was interested in a rider called ovett .. ` he was a fan of my dad 's , ' says freddy .. steve cram and ovett during the heats of the men 's 1500 metres event at the summer olympics in 1984. he shares an apartment with a french rider and a chef comes in to cook lunch and dinner .. the team is paying for french classes -- he goes to school for three hours a day .. the question of his nationality is unresolved .. enquiries were made about him riding for scotland at last year 's commonwealth games , but he is undecided .. ` i have dual citizenship .. i do n't want to rush anything , ' he explains .. he is wary of declaring for britain or australia when he feels he has n't proved himself deserving of a place in either national team .. steve was a 1980 olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of british sport. ` i need to learn in under 23 racing before trying to be a hero , ' he says .. ` but i 'm definitely not opposed to representing the uk . '. what does his dad think ?. ` i do n't know , he 's good at letting me feel my own way .. he 's trying to not put too much pressure on me .. both ( british and australian ) set-ups are really good -- both have incredibly strong national teams . '. last year , during his first racing trip to europe , ovett stayed with his agent , baden cooke , in monaco , which is also where froome and his sky team-mate richie porte live .. freddy , 21 , is based in chambery in the alps , in an apartment owned by his new team , ag2r. ` it was fantastic , ' says ovett .. ` i went on quite a few rides with richie and got on really well with him -- he checks up on me .. and i rode with chris , including one ride where he was training for the vuelta .. ` he is such a nice guy and i read a bit about him -- he is like this african maasai warrior , extremely talented but he could n't get a handle on how to race .. ` i do n't compare myself with him but i can relate to that .. i feel strong enough to make up for my poor bunch racing skills , but i know i 've got so much to learn . '. freddy was a promising middle-distance runner and in 2012 won a scholarship to the university of oregon
comotion : a meeting of staffordshire bull terriers turned into a brawl in halesowen , west midlands. their pet dogs have an unfortunate reputation for aggression , but now it 's angry bull terrier breeders who are in the dog house -- after their club meeting erupted into a furious row .. insults and punches were said to have been exchanged at the annual meeting of the staffordshire bull terrier club , and police are investigating after a 56-year-old woman complained that she was assaulted .. the incident resulted in the club president and other officers resigning on the spot .. the drink-fuelled events were the culmination of a long-standing row over a vote for a club officer at the previous year 's meeting .. about 90 people turned up at cradley labour club in halesowen , west midlands , last month for the meeting .. according to the club , one of its aims is to ` foster a feeling of fellowship among fanciers ' .. but trouble started when president barbara beaufoy was asked by member marie stokes , from walsall , why there was no record in the minutes of concerns about the handling of the vote for the officer in 2014 .. a witness , who did not wish to be named , said : ` mrs beaufoy said , " sit down , you silly little girl .. we do n't have to listen to scum like you " .. marie then stormed out . '. the witness said that as mrs stokes left , another delegate , graham hyde , started slow hand-clapping and chanting : ` out !. mr hyde -- who is approved by the kennel club to judge staffie shows -- was asked by club member karon jackson , from cannock , staffordshire , to keep order .. the witness said : ` he started shouting at her and arguing with her because she 'd asked him to sit down .. then i heard someone say he 'd hit karon -- he 'd arm-punched her in the chest . '. invitation a poster for the staffordshire bull terrier show which took place on sunday february 22. another source , who also wished to remain anonymous , said : ` we are working hard to improve the image of staffies and this happens .. we think it was because the bar was open and the meeting went to pieces after people had a few drinks . '. mr hyde , 57 , denied hitting mrs jackson and said he was assaulted .. ` there was no way i landed a finger on karon jackson , ' he said .. ` i was verbally and physically attacked .. i admit i applauded and shouted when marie stokes walked out because i was glad to see her leave . '. brawl : about 90 people turned up at cradley labour club ( above ) in halesowen , west midlands , last month for the meeting in which a fight broke out. the meeting descended into chaos when mrs beaufoy and the other club officers resigned and walked out .. mrs jackson has made a formal statement to staffordshire police .. neither she nor mrs stokes were available for comment .. west midlands police said : ` we have been made aware of an allegation of assault .

they might not have had quite as rapturous a reception as ` willkat ' but ` chacam ' , as the local media has christened them , certainly know how to put on a show .. so far , the star is proving to be camilla who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the british ambassador 's residence in washington d.c last night .. resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by bruce oldfield and her trademark pearl choker , the duchess of cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of prince charles .. glamorous : camilla in a chic bruce oldfield gown during a banquet on the second day of the us tour. looking good : the duchess has also used the occasion to show off a chic new haircut. but camilla is n't the only one who has proved a hit with the us public , with charles also pulling in the crowds - most obviously during a whistle-stop tour of washington 's many monuments yesterday .. arriving to cries of ` welcome your highness ! '. , a clearly delighted prince of wales happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the lincoln memorial .. not everyone knew who they were however , with one little boy asking his mother : ` who is that man ? '. ` the future king of england , ' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her iphone .. charles and camilla are now on the third day of a four-day state visit that has been described as ` your grandfather 's royal visit ' by the local washington post .. new name : the royal couple have been re-christened ` chacam ' by the local media. warm welcome : both charles and camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people. in a piece headlined , ` camilla and charles do n't get the willkat [ william and kate ] treatment , but it 's still royal ' , the paper went on to contrast the ` high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band ' that greeted the duke of cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father .. but while charles and camilla are n't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation , the visit is seen as ` crucial ' - for charles at least .. that echoes comments made by british ambassador to the us sir peter westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for anglo-american relations . '. i am so pleased to welcome the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall back to the united states , ten years after their first official visit together , ' he said ahead of the royal couple 's arrival on tuesday night .. looking around : charles and camilla spent their first full day touring washington d.c. star of the show : camilla , who is clearly been enjoying the tour , has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome. yesterday , the duchess obligingly posed for a selfie outside the lincoln memorial. cheering for charles : local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the lincoln memorial. ` their trip to washington and kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values , combating climate change , preserving the natural environment , creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the royal family play in keeping that relationship special . '. much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries , among them the 800th birthday of the magna carta and the 150th anniversary of abraham lincoln 's assassination .. both were ticked off the list yesterday , with charles and camilla starting the day at the lincoln memorial in washington and , in charles ' case , ending it at the national archives for a viewing of the 1297 magna carta .. today 's schedule , which , if yesterday is any indication , will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press , will see ` chacam ' visit president lincoln 's cottage in washington d.c.. later , the royal couple will be whisked to the white house where they will meet president obama in the oval office for the second time since he took office .. president obama is the sixth american president to entertain charles , who has visited the us on 23 separate occasions , during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last .. tour : yesterday afternoon saw them visit mount vernon , the home of president george washington. patriotic : camilla is introduced to a british airedale named gunner who was dressed in a union flag scarf. cuddle : gunner was on the receiving end of a right royal pat courtesy of the duchess of cornwall. pleased to see you : camilla gets a warm welcome from performers at the shakespeare theatre company. shake on it : the duchess shakes hands with well-wishers as she leaves the shakespeare theatre company
the head of u.s. intelligence has warned congress that not renewing the nsa 's controversial phone snooping program will ` raise the risk ' of another terror incident .. james clapper claims failing to extend part of the patriot act , which allows the bulk collection of telephone records , will take away a vital tool in the kit of the intelligence agency .. should congress not renew section 215 - due to expire on june 1 - then it must be prepared to shoulder the blame should an ` untoward incident ' take place , the director of national intelligence added during a question and answer session in new york on monday .. warning : clapper told a meeting in new york that failure to renew section 215 of the patriot act - which allows mass collection of phone records - would effectively raise the risk of a terrorist incident. ` in the end , congress giveth and congress taketh away , ' clapper told the group gathered at the council on foreign relations .. ` if the congress in its wisdom decides the juice is not worth the squeeze that 's fine : the intelligence community will do all it can within the law to do what it can to protect the country .. ` but i have to say , every time we lose another tool in our tool kit , it raises the risk .. ` if that tool is taken away from us , and some untoward incident happens which could have been thwarted if we had it , i just hope that everyone involved in that decision assumes responsibility . '. ` insurance ' : section 215 - revealed by edward snowden - has not prevented a single incident since it was brought in. section 215 of the patriot act - which also allows the nsa to obtain surveillance warrants without naming the person being wiretapped , as well as allowing the surveillance of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity but not affiliated with a terrorist organisation - was one of the most controversial powers brought to light by former security contractor edward snowden .. it has since been claimed section 215 , set up in the wake of september 11 , has failed to stop one terrorist incident , leading to calls for it being reformed , or dropped altogether .. senator patrick leahy brought forward a bill last year , supported by clapper , which would have meant phone companies were in charge of keeping the records rather than the fbi or nsa .. but republicans blocked the sweeping overhaul when it came before the senate last november .. however , clapper remains a defender of the program .. ` section 215 , to me , is like my fire insurance policy , ' he said on monday .. ` my house has not burned down , but every year i buy fire insurance just in case .

luis enrique says england 's lack of a winter break may have given barcelona an advantage against manchester city -- and he hopes the premier league do n't change their fixture list .. manuel pellegrini suggested after city 's 1-0 defeat in the nou camp that the number of games english clubs played in december and january meant they struggled in the latter stages of the champions league .. city 's 3-1 aggregate defeat followed arsenal 's exit at the hands of monaco on tuesday and chelsea 's defeat by paris saint-germain last week -- leaving no english clubs in the last eight of the champions league for the second time in three seasons .. luis enrique conceded barcelona may have an advantage over english sides due to the winter break. ivan rakitic ( right ) scored as barcelona beat manchester city 1-0 in the nou camp on wednesday. city manager manuel pellegrini believes the games his team play over christmas hinder them in europe. and enrique has some sympathy for pellegrini .. ` we are used to resting during winter with our families , ' enrique said . '. i heard ( southampton manager ) ronald koeman complaining about the number of fixtures in england , so maybe it is an advantage for us . '. i do n't know , it is impossible to say , but we do enjoy watching the english teams playing on boxing day . '. speaking after the game , pellegrini suggested the heavy fixture scheduling played a part in city 's demise .. lionel messi 's barcelona eliminated city by beating them 3-1 on aggregate in the champions league. for the second time in three years , there are not any english teams in the last eight of the champions league. pellegrini said : ` it is difficult to analyse because the premier league is strong , with money and very good players .. ` we play so many games in december and january and we are not fresh in february .. in spain , italy and germany they stop playing .. last year we played nine games in december and nine in january , and that was before we played barcelona .

a tooth belonging to a peking man -- an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades .. it was found in one of 40 forgotten boxes at the museum of evolution at uppsala university , sweden , allowing scientists to re-examine it using modern techniques .. from wear-and-tear on the canine tooth , they say that the individual it belonged to was quite old when she died and probably gnawed on bones and crunched on hard nuts .. a tooth belonging to the peking man -- an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades in an unopened box in a museum. fossils , including a number of teeth , were found in caves in zhoukoudian near beijing in the 1920s , but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of world war two .. the tooth surfaced in 2011 in a box that had never been unpacked or studied since it was shipped from china in the 1920s .. the tooth indicates that peking man ( a bust is pictured ) gnawed on bones and ate nuts. two chinese palaeontologists , liu wu and tong haowen from the institute of vertebrate palaeontology and palaeoanthropology ( ivpp ) in beijing have now examined the tooth and it has at last been described in the journal acta anthropologica sinica .. they quickly determined that it was a canine tooth from a peking man .. ` it is a spectacular find , ' said per ahlberg , who was one of the team who came across it in the box .. ` we can see numerous details that tell us about this individual 's life .. ` the crown of the tooth is relatively small , which indicates that it belonged to a woman .. ` the tooth is quite worn , so the individual must have been quite old when she died .. ` in addition , two large chips have been knocked out of the enamel , as if hit by something , or perhaps by biting into something really hard such as a bone or a hard nut .. ` at least one of the chips was old when the individual died , since it is partly worn down . '. dr ahlberg told mailonline the woman may have been between 30 and 40 years old when she died , which was a ripe age at the time .. previous studied have shown that the peking man used fire to stay warm and wore animal hides .. the very first samples of the prehistoric ancestor were found by otto zdansky from uppsala university in the 1920s and are on show alongside a third tooth discovered in the 1950s , at the museum .. it became a world sensation in 1927 when crania and other bones were found at the site by wenhao weng of the geological survey of china and canadian davidson black , who had taken over the excavations .. peking man , an ancient human ancestor lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago .. the name describes the species , not an individual and around 15 partial crania have been found .. examination of a tooth now shows that the species ate nuts and meat with wear and tear indicating he gnawed on bones .. in order to survive the harsh weather , peking man would have needed to be able to create and manage fire , and now there is solid proof to back this theory in the form of soil samples .. it 's thought the peking man wore animal hides that had been softened using stone tools .. belonging to the species homo erectus , the peking man was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed objects , but it is not understood why .. fossils , including a number of teeth , were found in caves in zhoukoudian ( marked on the map with an ` a ' ) near beijing in the 1920s , but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of world war two. the peking man became a world sensation in 1927 when crania ( pictured ) and other bones were found at the site by wenhao weng of the geological survey of china and canadian davidson black. sadly , the unique collection disappeared during the chaos of the world war two and has never been found since , but over the last decades , several fossils of homo erectus have been found in other parts of the world . '. ` we now know that the species is a direct ancestor to the modern man .. ` however , the lost materials of the peking man remain one of palaeontology 's greatest mysteries and most tragic losses ' , said dr ahlberg .. archaeologists first arrived in zhoukoudian in 1921 where they were directed to the site by quarrymen .. first , human teeth were found at the site but it was canadian scientist davidson black who made some of the most significant discoveries , including a skull , despite his initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the world .. around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the japanese invasion .. sadly , the vast majority of the finds disappeared during the chaos of the world war two and have never been found since , making the discovery of the tooth especially important. fossils were placed in the cenozoic research laboratory of the peking union medical college for safe-keeping , before being packed up for the us in 1941 .. but the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern china .. it is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on japanese ship the awa maru in 1945 .. us financier christopher janus appealed for information on their whereabouts in 1972 , promising a reward of $ 5,000 .. one woman made contact , demanding $ 500,000 , but nothing ever came of the approach .. the chinese government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of world war two.the fossils , however , have yet to be located .

cctv footage of a ` brutal ' arrest that shows one officer repeatedly kneeing a man in the back and punching his upper body has been uploaded to social media and viewed almost 30,000 times .. the footage , from 2013 , captures the dramatic arrest of the couple after a night out in stockton-on-tees .. the incident allegedly left music fan darran dunford unconscious and urinating blood for a week while his former partner , leigh leach , was left traumatised by her rough treatment at the hands of officers .. darran dunford , pictured , has successfully campaigned to have three police officers investigated over his ` brutal ' arrest where one repeatedly kneed him in the back and punched his body in august 2013. mr dunford , was held down by police officers and was knocked unconscious in the course of the arrest. he said he was urinating blood for a week following the incident in stockton-on-tees in august 2013. three officers at the centre of an investigation into the arrest should face a misconduct hearing , an independent police complaints commission ( ipcc ) has now revealed .. while cleveland police insisted its officers acted in accordance with protocol during the arrest , the couple involved have now had their complaints upheld by the ipcc .. the report says there is a case for disciplinary proceedings against the three officers involved and recommends they face a misconduct hearing over the arrest .. it comes despite an initial investigation by the ipcc and north yorkshire police which found cleveland police had no case to answer over the incident in august , 2013 - a decision mr dunford appealed .. the incident , captured on cctv , shows one officer attending to the injured policeman while other officers restrain mr dunford and one repeatedly knees him in the back. the 45-year-old contractor from thornaby said : ' i tried to shrug it off but it really affects me - if i see a police van i think something 's going to happen and leigh was a nervous wreck afterwards .. ` it 's destroyed my life as it was and the whole violent affair has changed me hugely . '. he said the incident had placed a great strain on his relationship with ms leach and that the couple have since split .. one of the officers admitted punched mr dunford in the face and kneeing him nine times during the incident. mr dunford called for the officers responsible to be removed from the force , adding : ` the police are not judges or punishers , that 's what the courts do and the police ca n't go around acting like this . '. cleveland police have already responded to the latest report - which will now be considered by the ipcc before a final decision is made .. the couple had been making their way home from a folk festival in stockton when mr dunford was stopped by officers on stockton high street responding to reports of a man being drunk and disorderly in a nearby pub .. he was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car .. however , cleveland police said mr dunford headbutted the officers , sparking an arrest which ms leach went on to describe as ` brutal ' and ` thuggish ' .. the footage shows several officers pinning mr dunford to the road before pc darren keeley presses his head to the ground - a manoeuvre he says which left him unconscious .. dunford was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car. pc michael wilson is captured repeatedly kneeing him in the back before delivering a series of blows to his upper body .. in a police statement seen by reporters pc wilson also admitted to punching mr dunford in the face .. he said : ' ... to distract him from his attempts to bite and resist i have punched dunford with my right fist clenched , in the left side of his face . '. i used nine knee strikes during the struggle , which lasted a considerable amount of time . '. when the matter was first reported in december 2013 , cleveland police said the tactics were approved and necessary as mr dunford was resisting arrest .. however , the ipcc report said : ` from the cctv footage it does appear that mr dunford is at stages non-compliant with the police .. ` however , it appears that pc wilson continues to deliver knee strikes to mr dunford 's back even when he has stopped resisting and is laying still .. ` also , pc keeley states that he delivered punches to mr dunford to stop him from scratching him , however , pc keeley appears to have moved his leg out of the reach of mr dunford when he delivers the strikes .. ` in my view , a disciplinary tribunal could take the view that pc wilson and pc keeley both have used excessive force and have a case to answer for gross misconduct . '. the report also recommends a misconduct hearing for a third officer , pc gareth humphrey , in relation to the arrest of leigh leach .. footage shows her being approached by pc humphrey before being forcibly taken to the ground and arrested for being drunk and disorderly .. in an earlier interview , ms leach said : ` the level of aggression was awful .. when they arrested me , my dress was pulled up showing my underwear .. i asked them to pull it down but even the wpc refused to touch me .. ` it was humiliating and degrading , i 'm a size 8 , 45-year-old mother and was no threat . '. pc humphrey initially said ms leach was abusive but , following a court hearing , charges against her were dropped when the crown prosecution service found the cctv footage contradicted the pc 's evidence .. dunford pleaded guilty to assaulting a male officer , assaulting a female officer , and possession of cannabis following the incident involving the cctv .. a spokeswoman for cleveland police said : ` no determination has been made yet and the matter is currently still with the ipcc commissioner .. ` only when this is complete will we consider what - if any - action needs to be taken by the force .

wales coach robin mcbryde has warned fans that attractive and entertaining rugby is low on the agenda ahead of saturday 's rbs 6 nations test against ireland .. recent comments from all blacks boss steve hansen about the game being ` geared towards defences that inhibit attack ' have sparked debate around the sport 's marketability , with mcbryde predicting another war of attrition at the millennium stadium .. asked if he expects a feast of running rugby , the 44-year-old said : ` i 'm not too sure about that .. there is a lot at stake .. ireland are on course for a grand slam and just to get away from cardiff with a win , that 's all they will be looking to do .. wales coach robin mcbryde insists that winning rather than attractive rugby will be their main priority. jamie roberts ( right ) in action for wales during the six nations match with france at the stade de france. new zealand 's steve hansen recently suggested that rugby is being geared towards a more defensive style. ` with regards to playing any attractive rugby , that will come second .. that 's the nature of the game at the moment and that 's how teams are wearing each other down and , unfortunately , the spectators have got to pay a price for that . '. wales have beaten ireland just twice in cardiff over the last 32 years and mcbryde is expecting one of the toughest challenges to date against the championship favourites .. ` they are on a bit of a roll at the moment -- 10 wins on the bounce , ' said mcbryde .. ` certainly from the outside it looks a very happy camp .. this is quite a formidable ireland team and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them . '. all eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end the visitors ' grand slam push and keep alive their own championship hopes .. they have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from jonathan sexton and conor murray , with scrum-half rhys webb promising not to repeat the mistakes that england made in dublin two weeks ago . '. i do n't know if england did much analysis on them , ' said webb .. ` they did n't seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever .. we need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error . '. france 's jocelino suta ( centre ) fends off the challenges as he surges forward against wales. jonathan davies runs with the ball for wales as his side beat france 20-13 in their last game. france 's sofiane guitoune ( left ) is tackled as he makes a break during les bleus ' defeat in their last game. it promises to be an intense tactical battle between warren gatland and counterpart joe schmidt , with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired ireland lock neil francis during the week .. gatland was said to have ` the intellectual properties of a tub of flora ' , although ireland captain paul o'connell holds the kiwi in much higher regard .. ` for as long as i can remember we 've being trying to poach ideas from warren gatland , ' said o'connell .. ` we played wasps with munster in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an s&c ( strength and conditioning ) and nutritional point of view .. it was a rude awakening .. he makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking .. ` at the start of the championship , joe said the wales - england game was going to be the standard-bearer .. two years ago ireland beat ( wales ) in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against england .. ` they 'll feel the same thing is happening now . '. wales boss warren gatland watches his players in training ahead of the showdown with ireland. ireland coach joe schmidt talks with fly-half jonny sexton during ahead of saturday 's game with wales. a lot has changed since paul o'connell played the first of his 100 tests more than 13 years ago .. professionalism has been the key to the former shelf-stacker 's longevity , although he has not always been surrounded by such healthy company .. on the week of his debut in 2002 -- against wales in dublin -- the young and enthusiastic second-row had to share a room with former munster team-mate peter clohessy . '. i was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning , ' recalled a laughing o'connell .. ` the claw ' used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up .. i was well aware this was not the way forward .. ` obviously it 's changed a lot since then .. now in irish camp i take a lot of advice from ( strength and conditioning coach ) jason cowman .. jonny sexton is obviously ( another ) great guy to copy and follow . '. as the ball emerges from the ruck , ireland 's conor murray kicks it upfield during the match with england. scrum-half murray passes the ball down the line during ireland 's 19-9 victory over england last time out. ireland 's iain henderson ( centre ) braves the challenges of billy vunipola ( right ) and richard wigglesworth. murray brings the ball forward once more against england at the aviva stadium on march 1. in conor murray and jonathan sexton , ireland have the world 's in-form kicking half-back combination .. their aerial game-plan was predictable against england yet stuart lancaster did not have the players at his disposable to stop it .. wales , however , have one of the best defensive back-threes in the world and leigh halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into .. how well ireland anticipate that -- perhaps using sexton as a looping runner , if the wingers drop back -- will be highly significant .. at 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in , luke charteris of wales and devin toner of ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition .. they are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line-out throw , while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents ' .. their long limbs are used to try and steal ball , although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul , where both wales and ireland are particularly effective .. picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal ; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of alun-wyn jones and paul o'connell .. welsh defence coach shaun edwards claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area .. however , they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against ireland , who won 23 turnovers to nine against england in round three .. warren gatland 's game-plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of jamie roberts and george north .. getting on the right side of referee wayne barnes will be key , because halfpenny and sexton are two of the world 's leading goal-kickers .
a broken neck would have put paid to most men 's hopes of achieving anything in life , but instead it drove warrick brant on to becoming australia 's strongest man .. warrick , whose sister lauren appeared in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here earlier this month , suffered the traumatic accident playing rugby union when he was only 20 years old .. the future had initially looked bright for the young prop who presented australia at under-19 and under-21 level in 1998 and 1999 .. but after playing a year professionally in england for bedford , disaster struck when he returned to australia and broke his neck in pre-season scrum training with the queensland reds .. australia 's strongest man warrick brant overcame a broken neck to fulfil his dreams. warrick meets the world 's most famous bodybuilder arnold schwarzenegger .. he met the action star at the arnold strongman classic in columbus , ohio , a fortnight ago. pulling a large truck is much easier than it seems according to warrick. it could not have come at a worse time as the following weekend he was due to train with the australian national front-row training squad in canberra .. ` it happened at scrum training .. it was just one of those things -- an unfortunate training accident , ' he told daily mail australia .. ` i was in hospital for about a month and had two surgeries .. i was in a neck brace for six months . '. the road to recovery was a long one .. just being able to drive his car again was a big ask , but it could have been worse .. fed up with bodybuilding he began competing in strongman events to better utilise his training. warrick competes in the world 's strongest man competition in los angeles last year .. in this event he had to pull two trucks - the blue and maroon one behind are tied together - along a strip of road .. warrick holds his sister lauren above his head at an event to raise funds for the mcgrath foundation in brisbane .. lauren recently appeared in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here. ` when i first got injured i could not use my right arm at all because i 'd lost all my feeling in it .. i could n't even eat my dinner ; i had to use my left hand all the time .. it was a pretty tough time , ' he explained .. the physical suffering he endured though was nothing compared to the mental anguish he went through at the time .. ` it 's not just the loss of a sport that you 've loved all your life , but it 's the loss of a potential income as well , ' warrick told daily mail australia .. ` professional rugby was thriving , especially in england , and i thought i was set for life .. but i could n't have been more wrong .. in this event at the world 's strongest man competition in los angeles last year warrick has to throw kegs of different weights over a bar five metres in the air. ` i do n't think i 've ever got over it .. i would n't say i 'm bitter but i 'm still disappointed .. i 'm now working flat out and struggling to pay bills , which is the complete opposite to what i would have had if i 'd been a professional rugby player .. ` but i have to remind myself that it could have been much worse and i may not have been able to even walk , so i have to constantly remember that . '. contact sport was now out for warrick .. he soon put on a huge amount of weight and did n't know what to do with himself until a friend came up with an idea -- why not try bodybuilding ?. after moving into powerlifting in 2005 he set an australian record in the discipline. ` i had become depressed and was eating everything in sight .. my weight ballooned , ' he said .. ` but my friend got me back in the gym training again and a year later persuaded me to get on stage and compete in the queensland bodybuilding championships .. ` it was the best thing i could have done and my confidence started coming back . '. but after a year of this warrick realised that what he enjoyed was the strength side of training rather than the appearance .. the atlas stones is one of strongman 's signature events .. here warrick raises one off the floor .. the stones range in weight from 140-200 kilos .. instead of showing people his toned body he wanted to show them how strong he was .. he did this by lifting massive weights in the gym to start with , before moving into powerlifting where in 2005 he set an australian record in the discipline .. it was a simple transition after that to start competing in strongman competitions .. ` i always watched them on tv growing up .. it was great to watch because they were big and strong , but they were also amazing athletes , ' warrick said .. the fact that competitors were great athletes as well as being immensely strong was what attracted warrick to taking part in the events. warrick first competed in america 's strongest man in 2008 and 2009 .. the rest as they say is history .. last year he won the southern hemisphere 's strongest man title in melbourne and australia 's strongest man crown .. he is also the only australian to make the final of the world 's strongest man competition .. unfortunately a muscle tear will rule him out of the 36th year of the world 's strongest man competition later this month in malaysia , but he has nothing to prove at this stage .. he has pulled and lifted airplanes , trucks and buses over the years .. but it 's apparently easier than it sounds .. warrick puts much of his success down to his wife bethany who also acts as his nutritionist and physiotherapist. ` you ca n't really train for it .. you ca n't go up to an airport and asked them to pull one of their planes .. but funnily enough it 's not the hardest thing to do , ' he told daily mail australia .. ` it 's more like conditioning work .. it 's like doing a high-rep squats session where you just keep your legs moving .. it may look spectacular but in reality it is n't . '. not that being australia 's strongest man makes him the most famous person in his family .. his sister lauren was a member of the australian pop group hi-5 and recently appeared on television in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here .. lauren brant ( left ) keeps in shape by working out regularly in her brother 's gym at the gold coast. warrick 's daughter indiana was born seven weeks premature in december , but is now healthy and happy. feeling the strain : a muscle tear has ruled warrick out of the 36th world 's strongest man competition in maylaysia. his well known sister trains at the gym warrick runs in the gold coast .. generally she does her workouts with her fiancée warren .. ` lauren trains at my gym every day and is into general fitness .. she trains there with warren regularly .. all my family is into sport in some way or another .. we 've got a very athletic background , ' he told daily mail australia .. the 35-year-old trains four times a week for three hours each session doing a variety of weights regimes that will depend on the kind of strongman competition he 'll be competing in .. generally he weighs in at between 145-150 kilos .. warrick attributes much of his success to his wife bethany who is a former bodybuilder too .. she has travelled with him to strongman competitions across the globe .. ` she acts as my trainer , my nutritionist , and my physiotherapist .. she always makes sure i 'm in perfect condition for every event , ' he said .. warrick 's story proves that with dedication and perseverance you can still achieve your goals. the couple had their first baby , a girl called indiana , in december .. and it sounds like she also has her father 's fighting spirit .. ` she was born premature and arrived seven weeks early .. she was three weeks in hospital in the intensive care unit , but she 's all healthy now and doing well , ' warrick said .

a paleo diet guru who wrote a controversial cookbook with my kitchen rules judge pete evans has hit back at critics after it was revealed she performed voice-overs for junk food commercials .. in a statement released on tuesday , food blogger charlotte carr argued she never ` personally ' endorsed the products she spruiked in advertisements for cadbury , coca cola and kfc .. the revelations came just weeks after publisher pan macmillan dumped her controversial cookbook , bubba yum yum : the paleo way for new mums , babies and toddlers , after public health experts expressed alarm over a diy baby formula recipe in the book .

'. a department of health spokeswoman said authorities recommend that parents use commercial infant formulas if an infant is not breastfed .. she said the paleo formula is also concerning because it contains one-tenth of the calcium of breast milk , 879 per cent the sodium of breast milk , and 168 per cent the selenium of breast milk .. ` these are important nutrients to get right in the diets of babies , ' the spokeswoman said .. as a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy willow , and like most australians , my family are my highest priority and will always be .. i often have little control over the jobs that are contracted to me as a voice over artist , like so many freelancers in my field .. i am frequently presented with a package rather than specific clients that i can pick and choose from .. over the years as i have become devoted to eating and living a specific way , due to the health concerns of my family , i have been working with my agent to choose roles that align more closely to my values .. i have never " personally " endorsed any of these products since becoming a holistic health coach and baby food blogger .. i am a working mother and like everyone else , will do everything i can to keep my family safe and nurtured .. if im telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car , or catch a certain airline , or use a certain toothbrush , i may not drive that certain car , or use that airline or use that toothbrush .. i originally created this page out of love and kindness and to share my story so that any mum in a similar position who has been told to put their child on a gluten free and dairy free diet would have a place to come to for inspiration and ideas .. when you are told your child can not have these foods , sometimes its overwhelming and scary and you are unsure where to start .. this is why i created bubba yum yum .. a place of fun beautiful , delicious yummy food .. charlotte carr ( pictured left ) is married to australian musician wes carr ( right )

a picture is definitely worth a thousand words , especially in this mesmerising new time-lapse video showing a century of beauty in korea .. in the latest 100 years of beauty film , model tiffany lee is given makeovers showcasing the trends of each decade between 1910 and 2010 .. the fast-changing video shows the elaborate looks worn early last century from intricate woven looks to carefully styled curls - and how political change influenced styles .. the first look in the video shows korean model tiffany , at a time when korea was first under japanese rule. during this time , women preferred ornamented hairstyles and minimal make-up. what is truly captivating is the manner in which the styles mirror the economic , political and social disparity in the country during the respective decades .. between the 1910s and 1940s , the video captures how women copied beauty trends from japan , such as ornamented hairstyles , and emulated western trends such as finger curls from the flapper era .. the trends continue until the clip reaches the 1950s where the screen splits into two , to reflect the historical division of korea into separate states ( north and south ) , during the second world war .. in 1945 , korea was divided into two spheres of influence , during which america controlled south korea , and russia installed a communist regime in north korea , later surrendering power to china .. in the fifties , following the divide of the country , south korea showed an understated appropriation of western trends with tiffany wearing lightly rouged cheeks , scarlet lips and a styled quiff .. but in north korea , women were fresh-faced , hair was scraped back and the model is shown wearing a military cap , which signals the beginning of repression under the communist regime .. under the japanese colonial rule , koreans preferred to emulate japanese beauty trends , which in the twenties included pinned hair and fresh-faced make-up. in the 1930s , korea was still very much emulating japanese beauty trends , such as matte red lips and hats. the video is the latest in a series by cut.com , which created two demonstrations of 100 years of american beauty as well as a film that revealed the dramatic changes in female beauty in iran over the last century .. the latest installment in the series reveals how south korea 's trends continued in line with the western beauty after the second world war and beyond .. but in north korea , women 's styles reflected huge political upheavals and government propaganda , with women donning humble peasant hats , modes headscarves and army caps .. the american trend of finger curls were worn by style-conscious korean women in the forties. in the fifties , korea is divided into two states - the trends reflect that america controlled the south , and russia created a communist state in north korea. by the time it was the swinging sixties made it to korea , the divide between the beauty norms in the neighbouring countries was obvious .. the south , very much focused on capitalism , appropriating glamorous trends from the us or japan .. this is depicted by the berry-pink lips , pencilled-in brows and dark , bouffant-styled hair with a dramatic side-parting .. tiffany blows kisses alluding to female freedom and a growing sexualisation .. on the other hand , the looks for north korean women of the same time involves wearing wearing a bandanna , synonymous with labourers at the time .. the sixties shows a wide disparity in beauty ideals , with south looking to american trends and the north sticking with communist ideologies. north korea 's communist regime meant that women were encouraged to be labourers .. this is what was considered beautiful at the time and propaganda from the time emphasised this. while north korea focuses on women as labourers and providers , south korea follows american trends freely. this portrayal was created by the communist ideologies in the north : propaganda at the time highlighted the belief that dressed-down , healthy and hardworking women were considered beautiful .. tiffany even has freckles pencilled in , showing her exposure to the sun as a worker .. the seventies similarly saw south korea following american trends , as the model showcases garish earrings , a stylish bandanna , winged eyeliner and a beehive .. but in north korea , tiffany is depicted in a worker 's straw hat , and seen wiping sweat off her brow .. the styling reflects the diktats that were less about vanity , but more about what a person could contribute to society - this longstanding belief is shown by the fact that the make-up trends are pretty much unchanging in north korea from the fifties until the nineties .. the eighties were still seeing south korea 's preoccupation with following capitalist trends , as shown by tiffany 's appropriation of the ` techno ' trend .. in the 1990s , the north saw a widespread famine , bringing economic hardship to an already repressive regime. while south korean women made sure their hair was as big as possible , slapped on pink eyeshadow , pink lipstick and matching blusher , their northern counterparts wore simple bobs and kept their faces largely make-up free .. in the nineties , south korea fell victim to the techno trend , shown by the use of fake eyelashes , wild teased bunches and neon clips in the hair .. tiffany is shown joyfully dancing and pouting in a playful manner .. the 1990s saw a widespread famine for north korea , which saw around one million people die of starvation .. this explains tiffany 's sombre expression ; the hair is sleek and pulled down into a modest ponytail , and the make-up is subtle .. the noughties saw the south continue on its glamorous trajectory while the north was slowly recovering from the famine and laid a focus on nuclear weaponry and industry. in the 2010s , north korea has shown gradual social progress and freedom for women , shown by tiffany 's increased use of make-up and accessories .. the south have continued appropriating western trends. in 1992 kim jong il began to take over north korea , and instituted a policy whereby the military was emphasised above all aspects of society and dominated resources .. north korea conducted its first nuclear test , and travel restrictions were tightened .. security surrounding the country was also strengthened - all leading to a highly repressive way of life , where many people are denied basic human rights .. this is shown in the video where the noughties continue on its glamorous trajectory , but tiffany in north korea sees a return to the days where women sport military gear .. as time went on , south korea became an industrial powerhouse and women were able to campaign for legal equality and became increasingly independent .. this is shown by tiffany 's freedom in terms of her physical appearance : sporting tanned skin , garish jewellery and glamorous make-up , as well as pouting in a sensual manner .. at this time , north korean beauty ideals are shown to still be very subtle and modest in the noughties , but there are slight advancements in terms of hair accessories , and relatively minimal make-up with small dabs of eye shadow and slightly glossed lips .. for more 100 years of beauty videos visit http://youtube.com/watchcut and http://facebook.com/storiesbycut .
the charity race at cheltenham is supposed to be all about the taking part - except when serial winners sir alex ferguson and multi-champion trainer paul nicholls are involved .. co-owner fergie and nicholls were so keen for the ditcheat trainer 's head lad clifford baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount rainy city , who cost # 100,000 , had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the festival card yesterday .. the regulations , confirmed by a cheltenham spokeswoman , state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average bha rating to ensure a competitive race .. sir alex ferguson ( right ) and paul nicholls ( left ) were at cheltenham to watch rainy city finish fifth. yet rainy city , who is highly thought of in the nicholls yard , had no bha rating , and rival jockeys were concerned that fergie 's horse was far superior to the rest of the field .. the get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by cheltenham at their discretion .. in the event , rainy city finished an outpaced fifth , having led for most of the 1m 5f .. nicholls said : ` of course we wanted to win .. but it 's a charity race and we entered to give clifford a ride .

the small foam pieces used to protect fragile goods in boxes could soon power your phone thanks to a battery breakthrough .. researchers have developed a way of turning the so-called ` packing peanuts ' into carbon , which can then be added to the types of lithium batteries used in everyday gadgets .. during tests the packing peanut-based batteries could store 15 per cent more power than current technology - and they even outperformed similar batteries made of graphite .. researchers have developed a way of turning so-called ` packing peanuts ' ( pictured ) into carbon , which can then be added to the kinds of lithium batteries in everyday gadgets .. during tests the packing peanut-based batteries could store around 15 % more power than current technology. this breakthrough was made by dr vilas pol , dr vinodkumar etacheri and their colleagues at purdue university .. they presented their findings at the national meeting and exposition of the american chemical society ( acs ) .. the researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600 °c ( 1,100 °f ) to create blocks of black carbon .. these blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles , which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries .. these sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mah per gram .. by comparison , an iphone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mah and weighs 0.9 oz ( 28 grams ) , while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mah/g .. this means the packing peanut technology could make batteries smaller and lighter , yet more powerful .. typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200 °c ( 4,100 °f ) , meaning dr pol 's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly .. dr pol got the idea to turn these peanuts into nanoparticles and microsheets when he was taking delivery of new equipment for his lab . '. i looked at the packing peanuts and thought that while we are exploring " green " technologies , we should not be harming the environment by throwing them away , ' he said .. the researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600 °c ( 1,100 °f ) to create blocks of black carbon .. these blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles , which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries .. these sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mah per gram .. by comparison , an iphone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mah and weighs 0.9 oz ( 28 grams ) , while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mah/g .. this means the packing peanut technology could make batteries smaller and lighter , yet more powerful .. typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200 °c ( 4,100 °f ) , meaning dr pol 's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly .. the researchers at purdue university began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600 °c ( 1,100 °f ) to create blocks of black carbon .. these blocks were then flattened into microsheets ( pictured ) and nanoparticles , which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. drs pol and etacheri then tested the microsheets and nanoparticles as anodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries .. the lithium ions move between the electrodes during charging and discharging and the researchers said their anode works so well ` it outperforms commercial [ anodes ] , with a storage capacity higher than graphite , a typical anode material . '. and although the higher temperatures used to create other sheets create a more layered arrangement of carbon atoms to maximise performance , dr pol 's less-ordered materials are said to have a 15 per cent higher electrical storage capacity .. typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200 °c ( 4,100 °f ) , which creates more structured sheets .. by comparison , the ` disordered crystal structure ' of purdue university 's sheets ( shown ) lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit - making them more powerful. dr pol hopes his group 's new , scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries ( pictured ) within two years '. [ the batteries ] have disordered , porous structures , ' said dr etacheri .. ` the disordered crystal structure lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit , and their porous microstructure lets the lithium ions quickly diffuse into the microsheets and creates more surface area for electrochemical interactions . '. dr pol hopes his group 's new , scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries within two years .

10pts for each european cup/champions league win , 8pts for each top-division english title , 5pts for each fa cup or other european trophy win , and 3pts for each league cup win .. no ` one-off ' trophies such as the charity shield are considered because they are not the product of multi-match competitions .. and being a losing finalist does not count for points either -- here at sportsmail , winning is everything , second is nowhere .. the average league finish position for each of the clubs since 1888-89 .. we counted the number of players from each club who have played for england , all-time , ranking the clubs by total .. this reflects historic ` bigness ' .. we then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 world cup -- a measure of modern ` bigness ' .. the overall ranking is an aggregate of these two .. we ranked the clubs by their income for the most recent season available .. the biggest clubs have generally had the most money and been able to buy and pay the best players .. the trophies considered as ` major ' are those earned through playing a whole season , tournament or competition , so no ` one-off match ' silverware has been included , such as the charity shield or super cup , nor have we counted silverware won in events that have ever been ` one-off match ' occasions - like the intercontinental cup , which morphed into the club world cup .. some trophies are bigger than others ; few would disagree a league title is more impressive than an fa cup , or that a european cup is bigger than a league cup .. so we have weighted the trophies , awarding 10 points for each european cup , eight for each league title , five for an fa cup or other european trophy and three for each league cup win .. in fact when the clubs are ranked 1 to 59 on total trophy wins without weighting , the order is very similar to the order when weightings have been applied .. liverpool stay at no1 for example ahead of united , themselves clear of arsenal ( 28 trophies ) in third , aston villa ( 20 ) in fourth and chelsea ( also 20 ) in fifth .. when clubs have the same number of trophies the total points are used to separate them .. villa and chelsea have both won a european cup but villa 's seven league titles to chelsea 's four made the difference between that pair .. when the points are the same , the club with the higher number of most important trophies are ranked higher .. the full rankings of the ` biggest ' clubs by trophies accompany this piece .. of the 59 teams in our study , 46 of them have won at least one major trophy .. the 12 that have n't are ranked by how closely they have come , for example as runners-up in the fa cup ( which is as close as crystal palace , fulham and hull among others have come ) , runners-up in the league cup ( oldham ) and then by the highest position they ever achieved in the top division .. after the top five trophy winners come everton and tottenham in sixth and seventh places , everton ahead on points because their nine league titles , the last of them in 1986-87 , are far superior to tottenham 's two titles , the second and last in 1960-61 .. spurs are more cup specialists , having won eight fa cups , four league cups and three cups in europe , albeit not the european cup .. manchester city , newcastle and sunderland fill out the top 10 places , with rankings 10 to 20 dominated by former premier league teams , among them blackburn , wolves , nottingham forest , sheffield wednesday , leeds , huddersfield , sheffield united , portsmouth and preston among them , all of who have won the english title at least once and all of whom have won between four and 10 major trophies in their histories .. bolton in 23rd place are the highest-ranked club never to have won the title , and are 23rd courtesy of their four fa cup wins .. they are a place above west ham , who have also never won the title and have won three fa cups .. arsene wenger and tony adams beam after arsenal won the double in 2002. manchester city won their second premier league title in three years with victory in 201. kevin ratcliffe holds the football league trophy after everton 's 1987 title victory. chelsea claimed the first trophy of jose mourinho 's second stint with the club earlier this month

ed balls today ambushed george osborne on live tv by forcing him to agree to take part in a head-to-head election debate on the economy .. the tories had tried to argue that they would not discuss the idea of a clash between the would-be chancellors until the leaders ' debate had been resolved - which seems unlikely .. but appearing together on bbc one , mr balls forced mr osborne to shake on the deal , raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day .. appearing together on bbc one , ed balls forced george osborne to shake on the deal , raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day. mr balls insisted prime minister david cameron may be ` scared ' of a one-on-one debate with labour leader ed miliband but he was up for the showdown with mr osborne .. after he was put on the spot , the chancellor shook mr balls 's hand but suggested danny alexander , liberal democrat chief secretary to the treasury , should be included .. speaking on bbc one 's the andrew marr show , mr osborne said he was sure an election debate between the different finance spokesmen of the parties would take place .. asked if he was keen on the debate , shadow chancellor mr balls replied : ` of course , and i would like to go further .. george and i do n't need the broadcasters to sort these things out .. mr osborne tried to claim that his lib dem deputy danny alexander should be included as well. ` george is not a coward .. david cameron does n't want a head-to-head with ed miliband but i 'm very happy - i will have a head-to-head debate , just the two of us , the potential chancellors during the election campaign .. addressing mr osborne , he said : ` you can say now - are you up for it ? '. the chancellor replied : ` as i say , happy to have these chancellors ' debate , just as we did in the last election . '. mr balls extended his hand out to mr osborne to shake on a one-on-one debate , telling the chancellor : ` come on george , let 's go for it . '. mr osborne appeared hesitant , saying he would be happy to meet mr balls in a debate .. he shook the shadow chancellor 's hand , adding to mr balls : ` we 're going to see who else wants to be part of it .. i have got a very effective chief secretary who i think would also want to be part of that debate . '. mr balls added : ` if only david cameron was up for a one-to-one debate like george , it would be alright - for some reason david cameron is running scared . '. mr osborne said : ' i think we should include danny alexander . '. mr balls countered : ` no , one-to-one .. we just shook on it . '. speaking on bbc 5 live 's pienaar 's politics , mr balls said he was unsure if mr osborne had agreed to the debate or not .. he said : ` he started shaking hands and he was agreeing to a head-to-head debate with me .. by the end of the handshake it sounded like he wanted to bring along his deputy danny alexander .. ` it was clear and then it was unclear .. i thought george osborne was going to do what david cameron has ducked for weeks and weeks .. ` he started the handshake doing it - by the end , constructive ambiguity i think . '. labour 's ed balls squirmed today as he repeatedly refused to rule out entering a power-sharing deal with the snp .. a surge in support for the scottish nationalists looks set to deprive labour of a majority and leave nicola sturgeon 's mps holding the balance of power .. lib dem leader nick clegg today vowed never to enter coalition with a party which wanted to break up the union .. uncomfortable : shadow chancellor ed balls appearing on bbc one 's the andrew marr show today. but mr balls refused to match the promise , despite being challenged as many as 12 times during a tv interview .. he would only say that labour has ` no plans , no need , no desire ' for a pact with the snp .. challenged on bbc one 's andrew marr show , mr balls said parties who ignore the need to tackle the country 's deficit are ` completely wrong ' and ` irresponsible ' .. but his opposition to the snp did not stretch to categorically ruling out sitting in cabinet with them .. told by mr marr to say the words " i rule it out " , mr balls replied : " ed miliband said it 's nonsense .. it 's not part of our plans .. ` you know andrew , you 've been covering politics for 30 years , parties , large parties at this stage say we 're fighting for a majority and we are .. ` i 'm not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals .. ` we 're fighting for a majority . '
labour and david cameron 's tories remain neck and neck , despite the conservatives being ahead in the polls. tomorrow the queen dissolves parliament and the election campaign begins .. it will be the strangest election of modern times and leaves the experts baffled .. most expected that , with economic recovery , and cameron ahead of miliband in the polls as favoured prime minister , the tories would pull ahead .. labour and the tories remain neck and neck .. only a fool , or a social scientist , would predict the outcome .. the two major parties now attract a diminishing share of voters -- about two in three in 2010 compared with more than 96 per cent in 1951 .. voters have a wider choice than ever before .. in england , they can opt for three other alternatives -- not just the lib dems , but also ukip and the greens -- all of whom score more than five per cent in the polls .. in scotland and wales , there is a further alternative -- the nationalists .. the weakening of the two party system makes a hung parliament very likely .. but , curiously , a small overall majority for the tories or labour could prove even more unstable than a hung parliament .. the tories would be at the mercy of their eurosceptic right wing , as john major was in 1992 .. he had a majority of just 21 , and used to say that he was at the mercy of 13 of them who were quite mad .. they made his life a misery when he sought to ratify the maastricht treaty reforming the european union .. a labour government with a small majority would be at the mercy of its left wing which opposes austerity .. labour , contrary to tory propaganda , is committed not to a splurge in public spending , but to public expenditure cuts , though less severe than cameron and osborne are proposing .. but labour austerity would disappoint the expectations of its supporters , many of whom look for rapid improvements in the nhs and social care .. speaking two weeks ago at the london school of economics , nicola sturgeon , the snp leader , advised english voters to support the greens or what she called ` progressive ' labour candidates , that is candidates opposed to austerity .. she hopes to create an anti-austerity bloc in the next parliament , composed of the snp , greens and left-wing labour .. that would cause problems for miliband even if he won a majority .. but , obviously , a hung parliament is more likely .. the key question is whether it will lead to stable government , as it did in 2010 .. many then thought , including myself , that the conservative/lib dem coalition could not last .. but it has , and with a comfortable majority of 78 in the commons it has never really looked in danger of being brought down in parliament .. the danger in 2015 is that no majority coalition can be formed .. under our electoral system , ukip and the greens are unlikely to win many seats .. that is why both support proportional representation .. the snp , which may well win many seats , will not deal with the tories and will not join labour in a coalition .. if , as is likely , the lib dems lose seats then , even if they were prepared to enter another coalition , that might not be able to secure the 325 seats needed for a majority .. this would mean that no two parties -- other than the tories and labour -- could command a majority .. we would have a fragmented hung parliament .. there would have to be a minority government .. the last minority government following a general election occurred in february 1974 after ted heath had gone to the country in the middle of a miners ' strike asking the voters to decide ` who governs ? '. the voters , however , refused to give a clear answer and , in the fragmented hung parliament that followed , labour governed as a minority for seven months .. there was then a second general election in october at which labour won a small majority .. minority governments do not last long and , being dependent on bargaining with other parties , find it difficult to take long-term decisions .. the longest-lasting was between 1929 and 1931 , but that was buttressed for part of the time by a pact between labour and the liberals .. under our electoral system , nigel farage 's ukip and the greens are unlikely to win many seats. in the past , the prime minister could try , as labour did in 1974 , to escape from the minority situation by dissolving parliament .. but the 2011 fixed-term parliaments act , providing for five-year parliaments , makes that option more difficult .. besides , there is no reason to believe a second general election would , as in 1974 , deliver a majority government .. it could easily reproduce the same result .. why have we entered this messy period of multi-party politics , and will it prove more than a temporary condition ?. i believe it will , because it stems from a new social cleavage in british politics , a cleavage between those who have benefited from globalisation , from social and economic change , and those who have been left behind .. the two major parties , together with the lib dems , represent the beneficiaries .. their leaders all believe britain should stay in the eu .. they all broadly welcome immigration .. they all favour gay marriage .. but many voters do not favour these things , and feel unrepresented by the mainstream parties .. alex salmond ( pictured ) and nicola sturgeon are doing to labour in scotland what nigel farage is doing to the tories in england. the typical ukip supporter is not , as we used to think , disgusted of tunbridge wells , a retired army officer spluttering over his gin and tonic at the 19th hole , but a working-class voter or small businessman or shopkeeper who feels betrayed and belittled by the system .. blair 's new labour sought to win over graduates and middle-class professionals -- those who aspired to leave the working class .. cameron 's conservatives sought to distance themselves from the image of the ` nasty party ' by rejecting thatcherism and embracing modernisation ; while cameron and osborne , liberal-minded men , seem remote in lifestyle and understanding from those left behind .. ukip , in consequence , is now the most working-class party in english politics .. the snp in scotland is different from ukip in many respects .. but it , too , represents the left behind .. the vote in the independence referendum last september was a class vote .. labour areas in the west central belt around glasgow voted ` yes ' to independence , while middle-class snp areas in perthshire and aberdeenshire voted ` no ' .. west dunbartonshire , with nearly the lowest life expectancy in scotland , voted ` yes ' , east dunbartonshire , with nearly the highest , voted ` no ' .. alex salmond and nicola sturgeon are doing to labour in scotland what nigel farage is doing to the tories in england .. the snp could well be the third-largest party in the next parliament , even though it will probably secure fewer votes than the lib dems , ukip and the greens .. that will strain the union to breaking point .. in england , cameron says if you vote for farage you will get miliband .. in scotland , miliband says if you vote snp , you will get cameron .. but , to the left behind , cameron and miliband are equivalent -- members of an oxbridge liberal elite who represent the exam-passing classes who do not understand the aspirations of the less fortunate .. that is why the multi-party system is here to stay and why we are about to enter an era of political instability .. anyone seeking a quiet life should go abroad for the next six weeks .

( cnn ) a decade ago al qaeda would meet potential recruits face to face ; now isis engages in one-to-one dialogue while sat 2,000 miles away .. with what it says is a $ 2 billion budget , the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka-clad jihadi brides carry kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian caliphate and a " guaranteed ticket to paradise . ". aqsa mahmood , 19 , left home for university one morning in november 2013 never to return .. instead of going to classes , she travelled to syria ; last february she married a jihadi fighter , and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for isis .. what is so unusual about aqsa is that she was given every chance in life : privately educated and offered freedoms that many other muslim girls would envy .. and while most were quick to condemn the mahmood family for missing the signs of radicalization , 18 months on they remain none the wiser as to what prompted her to run away -- aqsa 's parents had actually warned their children of the need to avoid extremist websites .. following the terror attacks in london on july 7 , 2005 , the then prime minister tony blair insisted those responsible were motivated by an " evil ideology , " a " perversion of islam that promoted absurd grievances , " and that they had nothing to do with the war in iraq , but he was wrong : the iraq " adventure " opened the gates of hell , and today young muslims are being seduced by an updated narrative .. for over a decade mosque leaders have been asked to eradicate extremism but they are no more than glorified gatekeepers whose lives bear little relevance to those of most modern day muslims .. the need to tackle radical preachers has crushed political debate and created a dangerous vacuum which is now being filled outside of mosques .. every new atrocity is invariably followed by useless public statements of sorrow from so-called " muslim leaders , " further increasing the anger felt by the younger community -- successfully drawing young muslims away from the path of violence takes more than routine declarations that " islam is a religion of peace . ". it is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents , but the steady stream of recruits to isis can not be ignored .. several years ago al qaeda recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in arabic in front of a black flag , followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards americans .. it was n't particularly effective as a recruitment tool , but then they only needed a handful of recruits to change our society for ever .. today isis runs a powerful , slick , modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms .. their propaganda contains the same violent , distorted interpretation of islam but it is more advanced than anything al qaeda ever produced , and the authorities can not police it or compete with it .. for many , the greatest shock has been young girls like aqsa wanting to leave behind their western comforts and freedoms to join isis , but why should it be a surprise that young muslim women are as angry as their male counterparts ?. there is no single road map to recruitment , but for a teenager becoming a jihadi bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber , however distorted that logic may seem to us .. full of adolescent frustration , young muslims are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by isis .. it does n't matter if the narrative is false , because isis is winning the propaganda war : the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the muslim community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers .. isis is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy , israel , rendition , torture , or assad 's reign , which has left 200,000 dead , because there is nothing that western governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards .. aqsa 's family describe her as a " bedroom radical " of the type the british government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media .. yet last year the international centre for the study of radicalisation and political violence found " little evidence to support the contention that the internet plays a dominant role in the process of radicalization . ". a concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists .. many young muslim people asserting their identity in an islamophobic society detest the hypocrisy of their elders , whose cultural and sectarian traditions they consider irrelevant to modern day islam .. while mosques pay lip service to the " brotherhood of man " they exclude 50 % of the community by discouraging women from attending , and anyone below the age of fifty is told to shut up and show respect .. as for racial unity , it is at best tokenistic and at worst institutionally racist .. young british muslims live a schizophrenic existence , stuck between their immigrant parents ' cultural identity and that of the west which does n't want them .. extremists exploit this identity crisis by offering them a new life .. most parents would n't know if their teenagers were drinking or having sex , let alone being groomed by isis ; many young muslims -- already adept at living a double life -- will hide their digital footprint in exactly the same way .. in many cases , there is tremendous relief for parents when a teenager comes home one day and announces she is becoming religious , rather than saying she is pregnant or on drugs , but it also gives rise to a false sense of security .. the failure to deal with the grooming of underage girls by isis is a child protection issue : when a paedophile makes contact with a child , he builds up trust over several months , convincing the child not discuss anything with her parents .. when the time is right he convinces the child to leave her family and join him .. the process is identical in radicalization by isis .. thousands of young people across europe are at risk of being trafficked to syria for marriage and holy war .. in any other situation , they would be regarded as children -- yet pin the isis label on them and the knee jerk reaction is one of condemnation .. the exploitation of the politics of fear combined with tougher terror laws has created a climate of fear for muslims who are portrayed as threatening a " civilized " way of life .. we are quick to forget recent history : the disastrous treatment of the catholic community in northern ireland produced a sense of burning injustice which acted as a recruiting sergeant for the ira for more than four decades .. today , muslims are being dealt with in the same way .
sean o'brien believes blowing a grand slam in wales ` might not have been the worst thing in the world ' as ireland eye the world cup after retaining their rbs 6 nations title .. leinster flanker o'brien grabbed two tries as ireland thumped scotland 40-10 at murrayfield to claim back-to-back six nations titles for the first time since 1949 .. the 28-year-old backed up scores from captain paul o'connell and centre jared payne as ireland denied england the title by virtue of points-difference .. sean o'brien of ireland celebrates with the six nations trophy after the 40-10 win over scotland on saturday. england saw off france 55-35 in a madcap twickenham encounter , but fell foul of the triple-bill super saturday set-up for the second year running , six points short on the target set by ireland .. happy to embrace hindsight with the title secure for another year , o'brien believes defeat to wales must now act as a harsh world cup lesson for joe schmidt 's men .. ` looking back now it might not have been the worst thing in the world , ' said o'brien , of ireland losing 23-16 in wales to spoil their grand slam chase .. ` we know we can learn and move forward .. that was the biggest thing to come out of last week : that we did n't do our jobs correctly and we did n't do what we did during the week .. sean o'brien of ireland goes over to score the second try in a 40-10 win at murrayfield. ireland 's o'brien scores a try during the 2015 rbs six nations match at murrayfield on saturday. ` if we approach the game like we did today , for instance , make sure everyone is going 100 miles an hour , we know we are never too far away .

'. i would n't say it was a different style ( against scotland ) .. ` we have been trying to play a bit like that the last few weeks but we have n't been , and we 've let ourselves down at times with our own errors as well , letting teams into games .. ` but we approached it the right way against scotland , did our jobs , and it paid off .

( cnn ) nearly 70 years ago , comic strip detective dick tracy showed off his first two-way wrist radio , inspiring baby boomers to babble into their knuckles in pursuit of bad guys like pruneface and the mole .. the gadget was updated to a tv phone in 1964 , heralding a fantastic future for mobile communications .. a half-century later the future is finally here , with a new wave of tracy-esque devices certain to accelerate following the much anticipated debut of apple watch in april -- which became official with the company 's " spring forward " preview on monday .. in classic fashion , consumers huddled around apple stores to get a peek , some even showing up wearing padded wrist " hoodies " to make room for the watch when it goes on sale next month .. naturally , apple faithful were urged on by tim cook , who tweeted : " got some extra rest for today 's event .. slept in 'til 4:30 . ". arianna huffington weighed in on twitter , too : " looking forward to a smart watch that tells me not to cram too many things into too few hours . ". analysts project sales of 25 million the first year and nearly 70 million by 2018 .. prices for the new watch range from $ 349 to a reported high of $ 17,000 for an 18-karat gold version to make any rolex show-off feel at home .. enthusiasm for apple watch -- and its long line of apps -- could lift the fortunes of samsung , sony , pebble and others pitching their own interactive watches , making the human wrist the most coveted piece of real estate since the redevelopment of times square .. if apple watch does indeed take off , it would reignite the emerging -- but tricky -- market for wearable devices following google 's sudden move in january to halt public sales of its glass product , which failed to catch on in light of what the wall street journal said were concerns over " privacy , technical shortcomings and a lack of obvious uses . ". the company is going back to its drawing board and hopes to re-introduce glass later this year .. as the wearables wrist race heats up , it 's worth considering how these meta-timepieces -- with their tactile messaging , biometric loops and eye-controlled display screens -- could alter everyday behavior and spur new codes of etiquette , not to mention a few novel personality disorders .. one of the most awaited features of apple watch will be its " taptic " engine , a sensory feedback tool derived from gamer joystick technology that allows for personalized tapping vibrations -- a " yo " - like blip for a work pal or an echo of your own heartbeat captured through an embedded cardio sensor .. of course , your intended recipients will need their own apple watch to " feel " your greeting .. early adopters will have to be extra careful with these taps -- imagine the explaining needed when someone inevitably sends a sonic valentine of their beating heart to their boss , or their child 's soccer coach .. taptic wrist vibes can also carry a purpose -- reminding you to pick up a carton of eggs on your way home from work , or delivering an insistent flick from a client demanding a call-back .. therein lies a brave new response in human conditioning .. all of us are accustomed to electronic signals -- an alarm clock in the morning or a pop-up calendar invite on your phone .. but there 's something manchurian candidate-like about a digital prompt delivered palpably to your wrist .. sure , the watch is a transmitter , but it 's the person who 's being programmed .. in the not-so-distant future , that driver you see lurching toward the off-ramp or the friend whose face glazes over at lunch could be in the grip of a taptic command from their watch .. as an accessory , smart watches are perfect for new spatial positioning technology , such as apple 's ibeacon , which can triangulate a user 's exact location inside a building and allow targeted messaging when deployed in , say , a supermarket .. wall street journal tech columnist christopher mims recently extolled the promise of ibeacon synched to your wrist device .. he wrote : " imagine walking into a grocery store with a shopping list on your watch , which knows your location so precisely that it can plot a route through the store , saving you the frustration of wandering from aisle to aisle , wondering where that one particular item is . ". that sounds great -- until the day our shopper , now utterly dependent on the beaconing system , discovers in a panic that she left her watch on her bedroom dresser .. " how will i ever find the a-1 sauce ? ". you laugh now , but look what 's happened to legions of drivers , who can no longer navigate their own cities without relying on gps .. look for more pile-ups at the deli counter once users let their watches do their shopping .. the real question is what strategies smart-watch wearers will devise so as not to appear to be staring at their wrists all day .. anyone who 's ever been trapped in an interminable business meeting or on an awkward date knows there are only so many ways you can discreetly glance at your watch before it becomes obvious .. now , suppose you 're trying to follow someone 's instagram or twitter feed or the score of the yankees game , or perform any of a myriad functions that phone users have been doing for years , but which might look a little ruder when applied to your wristwatch .. definitely expect to see more people fiddling with their sleeves , admiring their nails and earnestly cupping their brows with their opposite hand , in order to get a better look at the action on their watch .. many users may end up simply removing their watches and dropping them in their laps alongside their phones , so they can tap with one hand and swipe with the other .. as an unexpected boon to evolution , apple may soon be responsible for helping humans achieve a new level of ambidexterity , along with super-strong eye muscles .. of course , a constantly raised wrist puts a strain on the shoulder , which suggests we 'll soon be hearing about exercises designed to prevent watch fatigue .. some enterprising type might come up with a fashionable i-sling or support cushion to keep the arm and wrist sufficiently elevated to allow for hours of uninterrupted tapping and finger sketching .. with so many digital features to track personal fitness -- including apple watch 's " accelerometer , " which will measure total body movement , as well as the number of steps and calories burned in a day -- the new wearables aspire to promote extreme wellness .. the flip side is that such constant self-assessment will also lead to an increase in hypochondria and ocd symptoms among many wearers who already went nuts with their fitbits .. and get ready for a new universal facial expression to emerge on elevators , subways and at the dinner table , as users learn to open their little round retina using just their eyes .. it will be unblinking , mesmerized and zombie-like , with a hint of chin dribble : the smart watch stare .. i 'm looking forward to practicing my own version .. and if pruneface is out there listening , i 'm coming for you .
manchester city manager manuel pellegrini felt he needed to ` refresh the team ' and leave out captain vincent kompany for his side 's much-needed win against leicester .. kompany was dropped to the bench along with pablo zabaleta and edin dzeko , while samir nasri and fernandinho missed out on the squad completely as city beat the foxes 2-0 at the etihad stadium .. central defender kompany had come in for particularly heavy criticism after city 's damaging losses to barcelona and liverpool in the past week and pellegrini decided to act with the season threatening to unravel .. manchester city captain vincent kompany was dropped to the bench for the match against leicester city. kompany has come in for criticism this season following a number of high-profile errors for the champions. asked to explain his selections , pellegrini said : ` for the same reason pablo zabaleta , vincent kompany , fernandinho , samir nasri , edin dzeko - that were playing normally - i think it was important to refresh the team mentally and physically after two difficult games .. ` we have the squad we want so it was a good moment to refresh the team . '. pellegrini added that kompany , normally an inspirational presence in the side but in poor form of late , took the decision ` very well , without any problems ' .. city , trailing chelsea by five points in the barclays premier league having played a game more , were not at their fluent best against the foxes .. but they got back to winning ways with goals late in each half from david silva and substitute james milner .. manuel pellegrini revealed that he dropped his captain as he needed to ` refresh the team '. david silva shoots the ball past leicester goalkeeper mark schwarzer to give manchester city the lead. after a difficult few days , in which pellegrini 's future has been the subject of speculation , the result was a relief .. pellegrini said : ' i think always when you do n't have the result you need the next game is very difficult .. that is why the most important thing was to win the three points .. ` we dominated the game and had a good possession of the ball .. ` maybe leicester is at the bottom but if you see their results - they drew 2-2 against liverpool and against everton and were very unlucky not to draw against arsenal . '. city created a number of chances but were denied on several occasions by veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer .. yet they still lacked their usual spark and leicester were aggrieved to have been denied penalties on three occasions while riyad mahrez hit the post .. substitute james milner gets the better of morgan and danny simpson to doubled city 's lead. mark schwarzer dives but is beaten as milner runs to celebrate after coming off the bench. asked if his side should have had penalties , foxes boss nigel pearson said : ` yes .. three throughout the game - ( andrej ) kramaric in both halves , the second one you could probably say was a bit more marginal but there was contact .. the third one on the line is in the box . '. pearson would not get drawn into criticising referee robert madley , who also frustrated leicester with some of his decisions in an fa cup tie in january .. he said : ' i am not talking about them ( referees ) , sorry .. you can talk about them and ask the relevant authorities .. i do n't think there is any point me talking about the referee .. same one we had against tottenham . '. the result left leicester bottom of the table but pearson has no doubts about the spirit in his squad .. he said : ` they are a resilient group so we will have to get on with it .. we ca n't do anything about it .. it is up to the authorities .. our players give everything they have got and they have done again tonight .. ` there are lots of positive and we have to take them into the remaining games .. there is no point dwelling on negative aspects of situations that we have no control of .

kumar sangakkara dismissed talk of prolonging his one-day international career after becoming the first man to hit centuries in four consecutive odis as sri lanka swept aside scotland .. the 37-year-old is due to retire from the 50-over game following the world cup , but proved on wednesday that he is still an elite performer at the top level with his 124 against scotland following on from tons against australia , england and bangladesh .. sangakkara 's sublime knock helped his side hammer the minnows by 148 runs .. he was instrumental in making 363-9 before the scots were bowled out for 215 .. kumar sangakkara celebrates after scoring a century for the fourth consecutive world cup game. sangakkara hit 124 from 95 balls against scotland , the highest innings of the tournament so far. freddie coleman offered some resistance for scotland but they were eventually soundly beaten. calum macleod was bowled all ends up as scotland could only muster 215 in response to sri lanka. next week 's quarter-final could therefore be his final odi outing but , despite his prolific form , sangakkara insists he will not play on after the tournament down under .. ` it is never about whether you can play or not , ' he told the bbc 's test match special .. ` retirement is not about form , it is about time and place and whether it feels right .

" '. bryant and rogers remain friends to this day , though they are no longer romantically involved .. and 45 years later , rogers did find it .. nolan led him , now 58 , to the spot where he found the bottle , and his grandfather joked that he finally ` got it ' .. he had a good laugh and told abc that it was fun to reminisce about the ` good old times ' .. ` the more you think about it , the more it blows your mind , ' rogers told the slate .. ` there 's got to be some more meaning to this .

a petition demanding an outright ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first has attracted more than 100,000 backers - but the government insisted it still had ` no intention ' of outlawing religious slaughter .. vets chief john blackwell vowed to continue the fight , warning ministers they ` simply can not ignore the strength of public feeling ' over animal welfare and a failure to let consumers know how their meat was killed .. campaigners will now press for a fresh commons debate on the issue after quickly exceeding the six-figure threshold required on the parliamentary petition site to trigger a possible time slot .. a petition demanding an outright ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first has attracted more than 100,000 backers - but was still rejected by parliament. the controversy surrounds legal exemptions for religious purposes such as muslim halal and jewish shechita - which prime minister david cameron vowed to uphold in a speech last year to the israeli parliament .. opponents say they respect the various faith traditions but insist animal welfare must take priority - with scientific evidence clear that those that are killed without stunning feel pain .. the petition - which backs calls by the rspca , the british veterinary association ( bva ) , the farm animal welfare committee , the federation of veterinarians of europe and the humane slaughter association - points out that more than 80 % of halal meat in the uk is pre-stunned .. ` we must differentiate between religious and non-stun slaughter .. our concern does not relate to religious belief but to the animal welfare compromise , ' it states .. ` non-stun slaughter affects millions of animals .. we support a good life and a humane death for all animals . '. there are also concerns about large quantities of meat being sold without any indication of how the animal was slaughtered and the petition says that until a ban is imposed , consumers must be told what they are buying .. in a speech last year , prime minister david cameron vowed to uphold legal exemptions to animal slaughter rules for religious purposes such as muslim halal and jewish shechita. bva president mr blackwell said : ` this is a truly fantastic result for animal welfare .. ` bva has long argued that all animals should be stunned before slaughter to render them insensible to pain and we are delighted that the british public has got so firmly behind our campaign .. ` consumers value the high welfare of british produce and care deeply about the provenance of their food .. ` but under the current legislation meat from non-stun slaughter can end up in the food chain unlabelled as such , which is completely unacceptable .. ` scientific evidence tells us that non-stun slaughter allows the animal to perceive pain and compromises animal welfare .. this is an issue that affects the welfare of millions of individual animals every year .. ` the government simply can not ignore the strength of public feeling and we look forward to petitioning the backbench business committee for a full debate in the new parliament . '. the department for the environment , food and rural affairs ( defra ) remained unswayed by the petition hitting the 100,000 milestone - achieved by only 35 demands on the e-petition site since 2011 , around 0.1 % of those accepted .. a spokeswoman said : ` there are strict rules that govern the slaughter of animals in england which include additional conditions for religious slaughter and these remain unchanged .. ` the government has no intention of banning religious slaughter .. ` the government would prefer animals to be stunned before slaughter , but we respect the rights of jewish and muslim communities to eat meat in accordance with their beliefs .. ` existing rules require that where stunning is used it must be sufficient to make the animal unconscious and insensible to pain without causing unnecessary pain , suffering or distress .

( cnn ) although much of the united states has been shivering this winter , there 's been another worrying sign of warming temperatures farther north .. the cap of sea ice that spreads across the arctic ocean in winter appears to have been the smallest on record this year , according to nasa .. not only was this year 's maximum extent , reached on february 25 , the smallest on the satellite record , it 's also one of the earliest .. barring a late spurt of ice growth -- possible but unlikely , according to a nasa news release -- this sets a new precedent .. the analysis is based on data from the nasa-supported national snow and ice data center ( nsidc ) at the university of colorado , boulder .. arctic sea ice , frozen seawater floating on top of the arctic ocean and its neighboring seas , is in a state of constant flux .. it increases its area in winter , usually peaking between late february and early april , and then shrinks in the warmth of spring and summer to reach its lowest extent in september .. if this year 's maximum extent , totaling 5.61 million square miles , was reached on february 25 , it was reached 15 days earlier than the 1981 to 2010 average date of march 12 , according to nsidc .. only once before did the peak come earlier , by just one day in 1996 .. a peak of 5.61 million square miles is about 50,000 square miles below the previous lowest peak wintertime extent , reached in 2011 , according to nsidc .. scientists have been using satellite data to track changes in arctic sea ice , a vital habitat for birds and marine mammals such as polar bears , seals and walruses , for over three decades .. according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , ted scambos , nsidc lead scientist , puts the potentially record low maximum sea ice extent this year down to low ice extent in the pacific and a late drop in ice extent in the barents sea .. strong southerly winds in early march also played a role , according to noaa .. only the baffin bay area and the waters around newfoundland had more ice than normal this winter , it said .. scientists say it does n't necessarily follow that a low maximum winter extent will mean a record amount of shrinkage in sea ice over the summer , however .. while the winter sea ice extent was low in 2006 and 2011 , neither of those years saw an unusually low summer minimum , noaa said .. " the winter maximum gives you a head start , but the minimum is so much more dependent on what happens in the summer that it seems to wash out anything that happens in the winter , " walt meier , a sea ice scientist at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , maryland , is quoted as saying by nasa .. " if the summer is cool , the melt rate will slow down .. and the opposite is true , too : even if you start from a fairly high point , warm summer conditions make ice melt fast .. " this was highlighted by 2012 , when we had one of the later maximums on record and extent was near-normal early in the melt season , but still the 2012 minimum was by far the lowest minimum we 've seen . ". meanwhile , the summer minimum ice extent reached in the antarctic was one of the highest recorded , noaa said .. but this is n't cause for much optimism faced with evidence of a warming planet .. " over the span of the satellite record , arctic sea ice has been declining significantly , while sea ice in the antarctic has increased very slightly , " the noaa news release said .. " recent research demosntrates that the antarctic gains do not balance out the arctic losses : globally , sea ice extent has decreased over the past several decades . ". according to the nsidc , sea ice in the arctic appears to play a more important role in regulating global temperatures than that in the antarctic .
an iranian man who permanently disfigured another in an acid attack has had his eye gouged as punishment .. the man , only identified as hamid s. , poured acid over victim davoud roshanaei in 2005 , causing him to lose an eye and an ear .. an iranian court sentenced him to qesas , ` retribution in kind ' and he has now had his eye and ear surgically removed at a prison in karaj ,. eye for an eye : victim davoud roshanaei , pictured before and after the attack , had acid poured over his face and body , causing him to lose an eye and an ear. hamid s was reported to have been sedated in rajai shahr prison in karaj , 33 miles west of the iranian capital tehran , on thursday .. a team of doctors then removed his left eye , but postponed the removal of his right , state-owned hamshahri newspaper reported according to the new york daily news .. in addition to his qesas , hamid s must pay a fine to mr roshanaei and serve a ten-year jail sentence .. the surgery was meant to have been carried out in january , but was postponed after medical staff at rajai shahr prison refused to carry out the qesas .. ` the delay is from the medical side and is not our fault , ' a judge later told the state-run iranian fars news agency .. justice : mr roshanaei 's attacker was sentenced to qesas , ` retribution in kind ' , and has now had his eye and ear surgically removed at a prison in karaj. critique : an iranian human rights organisation has attacked the ` eye for an eye ' punishment , calling the practice ` barbaric '. ` we had a meeting with the forensic medicine and they will let us know once there is a doctor who is willing to carry out the sentence ' .. an international iranian human rights organisation based in norway has condemned the punishment , calling it ` barbaric ' .. ` removal of inhumane punishment in law and practice must be a prerequisite for any improvement of relations between iranian authorities and the international community , ' iran human rights 's spokesperson mahmood amiry-moghaddan said .. ` participation in such punishments are serious violations of the hippocratic oath and anyone who takes part in carrying out such sentences can not be called a doctor .

goodyear believes it has a way to extend your electric car 's range through tires that charge the battery as you drive on them .. unveiled at this year 's geneva motor show , the bh-03 concept tires combine thermoelectric and piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as the tire rolls .. ` this tire generates electricity through the action of materials in the tire that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions , ' goodyear said in a statement .. hot idea : the goodyear bh-03 , unveiled at this year 's geneva motor show , uses two advanced material technologies to capture extra energy from normal wear and tear. yahoo! reports that the thermoelectric fibers are woven into the tire , converting energy generated through friction caused by the tire 's contact with the road .. piezoelectric material would also capture energy generated in the normal physical deformation by strain energy harvesting .. it 's not clear that the tire could produce the type of energy needed to add significant miles to an electric car 's travel radius .. a study published in 2012 in smart materials and structures found strain energy harvesting through piezoelectric tire materials was feasible , but the experiment looked to power wireless sensors , not an entire vehicle .. the company also unveiled another concept that could take drivers off the beaten path .. showcasing its new triple tube tires on the lexus lf-sa concept car , goodyear says the tire design has three tubes that can be inflated or deflated to respond to road conditions .. high concept : the lexus lf-sa concept car , also unveiled , showcased goodyear 's triple tube tires , which use three inflating and deflating tubes to transform the tire 's shape to adapt to road conditions. the tires could change to provide extra grip during high speed driving , increase fuel economy by lowering resistance and even change shape to control against hydroplaning in snow or rain .. cnet points out that goodyear has used geneva to launch forward-thinking - though not quite market-ready - concepts before , having shown off a tire with two separate rings for different road conditions at last year 's auto show .. the outer ring of the suv featured a slick surface with grooves to displace water while driving on a paved road while a smaller inner ring had a textured surface for traction off road .

with millions of eligible men populating tinder , how can you ensure that you get a right swipe ?. ex-coronation street star scott wright is convinced he has the answer after conducting a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love .. the actor , who played stripper sam kingston in the soap and was previously crowned rear of the year , went on the world 's most popular mobile dating app with five very different looks .. he wanted to see which profile would get the most ` matches ' - where women indicate they are up for a date .. ex-coronation street star scott wright , who played sam kingston in the soap , conducted a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love on tinder .. he wore five different outfits and discovered that going topless garnered the most matches ( it probably helps that he 's a personal trainer ). by far the most popular of 40-year-old scott 's looks was when he stripped off for a topless profile picture .. within minutes of his profile going live , scott had 28 matches from attractive women all eager to engage with the star , who now combines acting with a successful career as a fitness guru .. this profile was seven times more successful that scott 's least popular profile - where he was dressed smartly in a work jacket and shirt , which attained just four matches .. once he posted each profile , he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives to gauge the popularity of each look .. the ` chav look ' was the second most successful of the five .. right : scott concluded that the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture , which , he says , perhaps explains why the ` normal bloke ' look got 16 matches. stylists created five different looks for scott : smart , chav , hipster , normal bloke and muscle man .. once he posted each profile , he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives in manchester to gauge the popularity of each look - and waited to see how many matches he achieved .. the experiment was carried out over two weeks at tinder 's peak times between 6pm and 8pm - with scott targeting different women so that the same women were not matching with him .. scott reckoned the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture .. scott 's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches. that might explain why the ` chav ' look , where scott wore a zip-up top , tracksuit bottoms and trainers got 17 matches , and ` normal bloke ' got 16 matches .. scott 's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches .. if scott 's experiment is anything to go by , dressing smartly virtually kills your chances of dating success with scott 's profile picture in a jacket and shirt getting just four matches .. scott made no mention of his previous tv fame because he just wanted to be judged on his pictures , though some tinder users may have recognised him .. the least successful of the lot was scott 's suited and booted look , which landed him just four matches. speaking about his experiment , scott said : ` obviously because of my work in fitness i am in pretty good shape , so i guess it is no surprise that going topless is the best way to get matches on tinder . '. i am thinking this strategy may not be be quite as successful if you have a beer belly and man boobs !. ` seriously , what it shows is that online dating is a minefield and by making small tweaks to your profile pictures , you can significantly increase your chances of dating success . '. a spokesperson for theidleman.com , who provided the clothes for the experiment , added : ` what this shows is that men need to be comfortable in their own skin when they are dating online - and i think the same applies when they are dressing to look good .. ` what most men want to do is pass the pub test : find clothes that look sufficiently good that their mates wo n't take the mickey out of them in down the pub .. ` if they pass that test with their mates , they will also adopt the right look when dating online .

prom is supposed to be one of best nights of the year for high school juniors and seniors , but sometimes it does n't turn out that way .. looking back at prom photos is sometimes an easy way to see why .. weird haircuts , strange poses and wardrobe choices that are just wrong await in the latest set of pictures from awkward family photos .. is it worse to be her , him or the rug ?. maybe they thought it was a magic carpet or something .. no tuxedo , no trousers , no smile , no problem ... at least the fringe on the jean shorts looks classy. there are three chandeliers in the background at this place .. they did n't help to distract from the foreground. maybe the laser show in the background was an attempt to call attention away from the suit .. they had their spot on the dance floor marked off with a stack of telephone books for him to stand on. the question is , who ended up with the flowers at the end of the night ?. where these guys were so serious looking because they were planning to fight over her after the photo was taken ?. when you do n't have a date , the best solution is always to go with a giant fish in a dress. the jacket and pants are even kind of cool .. but the chair makes this guy shine. at least this guy did n't have to worry about shelling out for a limo or sticking his date with the corsage. as soon as the dance was over , they ran off to go compete on american gladiators .. though the sunglasses made it harder for them to see other people , it does n't work the other way around. it 's a well-known fact there 's no better way to attract a suitor than by taking a photo with a tractor. they seem really , really happy .. wonder how they would feel if they saw this photo again ?. their first date was probably to go see the breakfast club or something else involving molly ringwald

a blunder from norwich keeper john ruddy ensured that the sky bet championship promotion clash against derby at carrow road finished in a 1-1 draw .. cameron jerome 's 18th goal of the season gave the canaries a deserved lead at the break and the hosts were controlling the game when disaster struck in the 66th minute .. ruddy had had little to do all afternoon but when required to catch an in swinging corner from debutant jamie hanson he somehow fumbled the ball into his own net to gift the defensive-minded rams a point .. norwich city 's goalkeeper john ruddy reacts after fumbling the ball to concede an equalising goal. norwich city players stand dejected as derby county 's players celebrate their fortunate equalising goal. the clash between second-placed derby and fifth-placed norwich got off to a cagey start , with bradley johnson 's off-target shot from long range for the home side the only effort of note in the opening stages .. norwich were very much on the front foot though and alex tettey and jonny howson also tried their luck from distance with no success against a derby side who looked as though they had come for a point .. on-loan midfielder graeme dorrans then had a clear sight of goal , only for a poor first touch to allow johnny russell to clear for a corner , before cameron jerome steered the ball just wide after being put in by wes hoolahan .. norwich city 's cameron jerome scores his sides first goal of the game at carrow road on saturday. without their main men up front - darren bent and chris martin - the rams barely posed a threat at the other end and it was no surprise when jerome opened the scoring for the hosts on 31 minutes .. a slick one-touch move instigated by tettey ended with martin olsson crossing low for norwich 's top scorer to slot home from close range .. derby 's appeals for offside were waved away and norwich continued to dominate , although russell 's quick dart into the box did provide a rare moment of alarm for the home side .. norwich maintained their grip on the game in the early part of the second period , with jerome heading over from a corner before lee grant 's parry from a steven whittaker snap-shot prompted a scramble in the visitors ' box .. norwich city 's gary hooper ( right ) and derby county 's craig bryson compete for the ball during the draw. jamie hanson and wesley hoolahan compete for the ball as both side look for the winner at carrow road. derby 's lack of a specialist front man was painfully obvious although tom ince 's low shot on the hour mark did draw a save out of ruddy .. but the norwich keeper then made a horrible mistake to hand the rams an equaliser they scarcely deserved .. hanson 's 66th-minute corner from the right should have been a routine gather for the former england keeper but he took his eye off the ball and somehow fumbled it into the back of the net .. city responded well to the shock and it required a brilliant one-handed save from grant to keep out sebastien bassong 's header from an in swinging hoolahan free-kick .. grant then denied substitute gary hooper as norwich looked for a grandstand finish before jerome wastefully headed a whittaker cross just over and johnson then followed suit with his left foot .

english football agents are to take legal action against the fa unless a compromise can be reached over the introduction of ` unworkable ' new regulations next month .. the association of football agents agreed unanimously this week to injunct the fa to prevent them from bringing in ` unacceptable ' rules from april 1 - after fifa washed their hands of responsibility for managing the middle men , passing the buck to the national associations .. the afa have engaged the qc and sports law expert lord pannick to fight their corner - with the threat of an injunction hovering over a summit with the fa called to resolve the issue .. the afa have engaged the qc and sports law expert lord pannick to fight their corner over new fa rules. the agents object to the way the fa intend to administer their lucrative work .. this includes a reduction in fees , no pay for representing players under 18 and a free-for-all with no agent 's licence required in future .. mel stein , chairman of the afa , said : ` there is no doubt that the upcoming regulations are unworkable and it will be an horrendous mess unless some agreement can be reached .. at least finalising a meeting is some kind of progress .

motorists in essex have been left bemused by ` britain 's most pointless lane ' - a bizarre road layout which is not even long enough for the buses it was built for .. residents in north stifford , essex , say the ` pointless ' bus lane on high road - which at 50ft long is not big enough for a double-decker - should never have been built .. the quirk in the road means cars and vans are forced off a stretch of straight road and onto a narrow ` chicane-like ' bend in order to avoid breaking the law .. residents in north stifford , essex , are asking why the ` pointless ' bus lane on high road ( pictured ) which is just 50ft long and is not long enough for a double-decker bus , was built .. they claim it is a ` hazard '. every week thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled to come along the route each day .. following a series of accidents , the lane has now been branded a ` hazard ' with motorists questioning what its purpose is .. emma taylor , 24 , a hairdresser from nearby grays , spotted the strange road layout when she was driving at the weekend .. she said : ` it really is bizarre .. i drove through it on the way to my mum 's house .

phil jones says public criticism of manchester united has fuelled the team 's recent revival .. united are now odds-on to qualify for the champions league after they recorded back-to-back wins over tottenham and liverpool .. such a double would have seemed impossible just a few months ago .. manager louis van gaal came under fire after his team put in a number of underwhelming displays .. phil jones ( left ) celebrates after united 's 2-1 victory over top four rivals liverpool on sunday. juan mata ( left ) scored twice to put united in the driving seat for champions league qualification. some of the strongest criticism came from ex-united players like gary neville , who compared van gaal 's side to a pub team and paul scholes , who labelled some of united 's play ` prehistoric ' .. but with united now five points clear of fifth-placed liverpool , their critics have fallen silent .. ` people criticising does spur you on , ' jones said .. ` you are always going to get critics .. we are at a massive club here at manchester united and if things are n't going as well as they should be then there is always going to be people wanting to have a dig and a pop at you .. jones admits that public criticism sparked united 's impressive performances in recent weeks. united also defeated tottenham in their previous premier league game at old trafford. ` we have been well aware of the criticism we have had .. we are professionals and we are in a job where people have an opinion about you and they are entitled to it and we just have to get on with it .. ` people can assume and predict and it is up to us to prove them all wrong .. that is what the lads enjoy doing .. we enjoy proving them wrong .. so far we have done that .
